AMZN,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Ken Fisher’s AI-Driven E-Commerce Giant with Expansive Growth. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

AMZN,"Amazon launches drone delivery in Phoenix. Amazon drone delivery has taken flight in the West Valley of metro Phoenix with its new Prime Air service. The online retail giant is now offering drone delivery to select Phoenix-area residents living near its same-day delivery warehouse in Tolleson, Ariz, Amazon announced last week. The MK30 drone developed by Amazon can make deliveries by air in less than an hour and is available for items weighing five pounds or less. “The MK30 is quieter than previous models. Prime Air’s Flight Science team custom designed the propellers to reduce the MK30’s perceived noise by almost half. Even as the drone is descending, its sound is still quieter than the range of sounds you’ll generally hear in a neighborhood,” Amazon said in October 2023, when it announced it had completed development of the drone. The drones will deploy from facilities adjacent to the Tolleson delivery site, which it described as “part fulfillment center, part delivery station.” “Our same-day delivery sites are situated close to the large metro areas they serve, which means customers get their orders faster. And with connections to the larger Amazon fulfillment centers nearby, we are able to offer same-day delivery on millions of items,” according to Amazon. Amazon said in a press release that its MK30 drone received aerospace certification in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration. The company added that it plans to expand the program in the coming months but did not give details. An Amazon spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. Amazon has been testing drone delivery in College Station, Texas, since October 2023, through delivery of prescription medications to Amazon Pharmacy customers. The retailer allowed eligible Amazon Pharmacy customers to select “free delivery” at checkout to receive the medications by air in less than an hour. Amazon’s drone program launched about a year after Walmart began its own drone delivery service in metro Dallas in the fall of 2023, through a partnership with Wing, a drone company owned by Google parent company, Alphabet.",Optimistic
AMZN,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon and Home Depot. Chicago, IL – November 11, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN and Home Depot HD. Most Trump voters believe he will boost their economic security and for many, the ability to support their families is a top concern. Appealing to people’s most basic needs such as their personal finances has clearly been a winning strategy, and if the results can be delivered, Trump will likely remain popular with those who voted for him. Although it is early days, and we can’t know exactly what policies will be passed by Trump, it is likely that we will see some sort of tax cuts for corporations and individuals as well as an easing of business regulations. These were strategies he implemented in his previous term with notable impact, and he’s likely to apply them again. What this means is that the average American citizen is going to have a few extra dollars in their pocket at the end of every month. That money will either get invested into the stock market or get spent on discretionary purchases. Two of the market’s leading consumer discretionary businesses are Amazon and Home Depot, and not only are they set to benefit from this new theme, but they also boast top Zacks Ranks and strong growth forecasts. Even before realizing the business implications of a Trump presidency, Amazon was among my favorite stocks in the market. But with this additional catalyst of a strong consumer, it goes straight to the top of my must own stock list. After spending the past few months trading mostly sideways since spring, AMZN shares have soared to new all-time highs in response to the election results, breaking out of their recent stagnation. And not only can Amazon expect growth from consumer spending, but its cloud services business is an absolute juggernaut, spewing cash thanks to the AI boom. AWS remains the world’s leading cloud computing business with 31% market share. Furthermore, Amazon currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have risen by 8.8% in the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have also jumped by 8.8%. Amazon is expected to grow its earnings per share by a very impressive 28.3% annually over the next three to five years, bolstered not only by its e-commerce business, but also by its cloud computing segment AWS. Home Depot is another favored place for cash-flush consumers to spend. With the rise in work from home arrangements, people are making improvements to their homes more than ever. Furthermore, millennials are finally breaking into home ownership and have shown a surprising ability to earn and build wealth. As older homes scooped up and taken off the market these new buyers are likely to be making improvements to their new abodes. Like Amazon, Home Depot also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings growth forecasts are a bit more tepid than Amazon’s, with projections of 9.6% annual growth over the next three to five years. However, as investors recognize these new growth catalysts, we may see that number rise even more. Especially appealing is the developments in Home Depot’s stock price action. After forming a clear bull flag over the last several weeks, HD shares have staged a clear breakout this morning, signaling that higher prices may be imminent. So long as the stock continues to trade above the breakout level, I would expect the stock to continue its march higher. As we assess the potential impacts of a Trump presidency on the economy, it’s clear that the policies historically associated with his administration could benefit stocks in consumer-driven sectors. With an approach that tends to focus on tax cuts, reduced regulation, and a business-friendly environment, companies like Amazon and Home Depot stand well-positioned to capitalize on potential boosts in consumer spending. Both Amazon and Home Depot stocks align well with a Trump-influenced economic strategy, offering attractive opportunities for investors seeking exposure to sectors set to benefit from a stronger U.S. consumer. Investors considering AMZN or HD may find both stocks appealing for their strong fundamentals and current momentum. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.

TSLA,"Tesla options draw 'euphoric' trading as Trump win fires up stock. By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed. NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are piling into bullish options bets on Tesla shares, with the stock hitting its highest level in more than two years on bets that CEO Elon Musk’s close ties to President-elect Donald Trump may benefit the electric car maker. Tesla’s shares were up about 8% to $346.12 on Monday and have rallied more than 35% since the Nov. 5 election. They now stand at their highest level since April 2022. Tesla's contracts were the most heavily traded options on individual stocks on Monday, with some 2.5 million contracts changing hands by noon - more than twice the usual pace, according to Trade Alert. ""It's euphoric,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. ""Tesla is by far the most active option at our shop.”. He noted a heavy concentration of call contracts at the $400 level, some 13% above the stock’s current price. Trade Alert data showed much of the trading concentrated in near-term contracts, with options expiring by Friday making up about 56% of the total trading volume. Musk has supported Trump for months and contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group, federal records show. The billionaire’s business ventures, which in addition to Tesla EVs range from SpaceX rockets to Neuralink brain chips, depend heavily on regulation, subsidies and policy, and analysts said they could benefit from a friendly administration. On Monday, Wedbush Securities raised its target price on Tesla shares to $400 from $300, saying they see the Trump White House win as a ""gamechanger for the autonomous and AI (artificial intelligence) story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years."". Tesla options struck at $350 and $400, and set to expire by Friday, were the two most actively traded contracts with combined volume of about 180,000 contracts. The bullish options action was also likely helping to push the stock higher, as options dealers who sold upside contracts react to the soaring stock by buying more of the shares to cover their own risk. ""If enough people speculate on certain strikes, the stock can have a tendency to move toward those strikes,"" Sosnick said. The big jump in the stock price and massive options interest also means Tesla call options are growing pricey and could draw sellers, said Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma. Should the stock fail to keep up with its recent moves, it might lead to a drop in the price of those calls, he said. ""That can pressure the stock down,"" Kochuba said.

TSLA,"Why Tesla Stock Keeps Going Up. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock continued putting pedal to metal as stock markets reopened for business Monday. Through 12:20 p.m. ET, the electric car leader gained 7.3%, bringing total gains since Donald Trump won reelection (with Elon Musk's support) to a staggering 37%. Oh, and Tesla is a trillion-dollar company again -- $1.1 trillion, to be precise. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». Today's gains owe in part to growing enthusiasm for Tesla stock on Wall Street. Specifically, investors seem to be reacting to a new price target hike from investment bank Wedbush. According to reports, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives just raised his price target on Tesla stock to $400 -- a 33% increase. ""The Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years,"" predicts Ives. More than just a reward for financial support that helped him win reelection, the analyst anticipates that a new Trump administration will clear out the ""federal regulatory spiderweb"" that has slow-rolled developments in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars alike. And while it's hard to quantify what that might mean for Tesla (Ives says $1 trillion, but really, that's just a guess), Musk has positioned Tesla to capitalize on these technologies. If a Trump White House works to get these developments fast-tracked, Tesla would be a logical company to benefit from that. Enticing investors with big, round numbers like $1 trillion, without providing math to support the number, is a great way to attract momentum traders to Tesla stock. More cautious investors, however, shouldn't ignore the math. After its run-up these past few days, Tesla stock now costs a distressingly high 88 times trailing earnings, and 322 times free cash flow. Tesla's going to have to grow awfully fast to justify those multiples. Worse, it may have only four years in which to grow before regulations change again. Do you want to bet on all  that growth happening in such a short time? Because I don't. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this. On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

TSLA,"Top Stock Movers Now: Tesla, Robinhood Markets, MicroStrategy, and More. U.S. equities continued their post-election rally at midday, fueled by optimism that the new Trump administration will be a positive for the markets. Tesla shares took off on expectations of benefits from the Trump win, plus a big jump in its price target by Wedbush analysts. AbbVie reported disappointing results from a trial of its experimental schizophrenia drug. The market surge from enthusiasm over Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election last week continued at midday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping above 44,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 also advanced, while the Nasdaq was little changed. Tesla (TSLA) shares again were driven higher by the election results on expectations of a reduction in federal regulations and CEO Elon Musk's ties to the incoming administration as an adviser to the president-elect. In addition, shares got an extra boost when Wedbush raised its price target by $100, calling the Trump victory a ""gamechanger"" for the EV maker. With Trump having said he wants to make the U.S. ""the crypto capital of the planet,"" companies tied to cryptocurrencies soared as bitcoin traded at an all-time high. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), Coinbase Global (COIN), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital parent MARA Holdings (MARA) all jumped more than 10%. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also soared when the largest corporate holder of bitcoin said that it had paid $2.03 billion to purchase an additional 27,200 bitcoin. Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Edgewater Research warned that Nvidia (NVDA) has canceled orders with the power solutions company. Shares of AbbVie (ABBV) plunged when the drug maker announced disappointing results in a pair of Phase 2 clinical trials of its experimental schizophrenia treatment.

TSLA,"Tesla shares surge, extending post-election rally. Investing.com - Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped by more than 5% in recent US trading on Monday, adding to its post-election 26% rally seen last week. The stock spiked by 8.2% on Friday, pushing Tesla's market valuation above $1 trillion, fueled by wagers that the company and its Chief Executive Elon Musk would be major beneficiaries of Trump's second four-year term in the White House. Musk had been an outspoken backer of Trump during the campaign, lauding the former president at events and contributing over $130 million to his re-election bid. Trump, for his part, has praised Musk's talents as a businessman and suggested he could play a role as ""Secretary of Cost-Cutting"" in the new administration. Prior to the election last week, which Trump won handily on a policy platform that included deep corporate tax cuts and looser regulation, Tesla's shares had risen by only around 1% so far this year. By the end of Friday, they had gained around 30% during that period. Tesla's market cap previously crossed the $1 trillion threshold in 2021. It is now back among a group of megacap firms that includes artificial intelligence-chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Speaking to analysts after Tesla's last quarterly earnings, Musk suggested he could use his influence in the Trump administration to push for a ""federal approval process for autonomous vehicles."" Musk has argued that the current process, which is handled by individual states, presents a regulatory hurdle for Tesla. The firm has recently targeted autonomous driving as a new growth engine. On Monday, analysts at Wedbush led by Daniel Ives raised their price target for Tesla to $400 from $300 and maintained their ""Outperform"" rating of the stock. ""[W]e believe the Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years,"" Ives wrote. ""We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth $1 trillion alone for Tesla and we fully expect under a Trump White House these key initiatives will now get fast tracked as the federal regulatory spiderweb that Musk&Co. have encountered over the past few years around [full self driving]/autonomous clears significantly under a new Trump era."".

NVDA,"Morgan Stanley Lifts Nvidia Target as Blackwell Product Sales Surge. Morgan Stanley (MS, Financial) has raised its price target for Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) from $150 to $160, citing Nvidia's recent bullish performance and anticipated easing of supply-chain challenges. Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Joseph Moore, forecast that Nvidia's new Blackwell product line will significantly boost revenue in the January quarter, with expected sales in the $5-6 billion range. However, these potential gains may face some offset due to ongoing supply constraints, which could affect current quarter guidance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Additionally, Nvidia's product demand trends reveal a shift from the H100 to increased demand for the H200, aligning with Nvidia's recent pattern of raising its sales guidance by approximately $2 billion. Analysts estimate Nvidia's January quarter revenue guidance could surpass consensus at $36.5 billion. Morgan Stanley also predicts an increase in Nvidia's gross margins through FY2026, though initial Blackwell ramp-up margins are expected to be lower. Nvidia's previous gross margin guidance dropped from 75.7% in July to 75.0% in October, a conservative estimate according to Morgan Stanley. Consequently, the firm has raised its FY26 revenue and EPS estimates for Nvidia to $176.78 billion and $4.03, with 73.8% non-GAAP gross margins. While Morgan Stanley considers this earnings period transitional, it maintains Nvidia as a top buy with an Overweight rating, driven by Blackwell's projected impact on late 2025 growth.

PLTR,"Investors Heavily Search Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): Here is What You Need to Know. Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this company have returned +34.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which Palantir Technologies belongs, has gained 16.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Palantir Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.11 per share, indicating a change of +37.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25.3% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $0.38 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52%. This estimate has changed +8.7% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.47 indicates a change of +25.1% from what Palantir Technologies is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.2%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palantir Technologies is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:. While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For Palantir Technologies, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $778.75 million indicates a year-over-year change of +28%. For the current and next fiscal years, $2.82 billion and $3.51 billion estimates indicate +26.6% and +24.5% changes, respectively. Palantir Technologies reported revenues of $725.52 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30%. EPS of $0.10 for the same period compares with $0.07 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $705.1 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.9%. The EPS surprise was +11.11%. Over the last four quarters, Palantir Technologies surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Palantir Technologies is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palantir Technologies. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MSTR,"Why Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Crypto Stocks Popped on Monday. The crypto market is on fire today, continuing a weeklong run since the election took place. Investors are betting that a more favorable SEC and Congress will lead to more funds flowing into the industry, and ultimately innovation. Tokens are moving big, but so are crypto-related stocks. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) was up as much as 23.7% in trading today, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) is up 23.9%, Mara Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) popped 31.2%, and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) was up 23.9% at its peak. The stocks were up 21.5%, 23.3%, 29.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, at 3 p.m. ET. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been the biggest cause of the moves in the market today. The impact on miners is clear because Bitcoin is the direct output of the mining they do, so if Bitcoin climbs, their revenue will go up. But they also benefit from the Bitcoin being held on their balance sheets. Mara had 18,488 Bitcoin on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter of 2024 and bought another $100 million more to exceed 20,000 Bitcoin in early August. Riot Platforms said it held 10,928 Bitcoin on its balance sheet as of October 2024. Neither company could come close to MicroStrategy, which bought another 27,200 Bitcoin this month and now holds 279,420 Bitcoin. The company is the largest leveraged play on the cryptocurrency, even using its stock and debt to buy more of the crypto near all-time highs. While the increase in Bitcoin's value is often seen as a positive for Coinbase, the real driver of the business is trading volume -- and that's gone through the roof. After hovering between $1 billion and $2 billion per day earlier this year, volume is now $7.8 billion in the last 24 hours, as of this writing. This will likely drive a sharp increase in Coinbase's revenue in the fourth quarter, and profitability and cash flow should improve as well. The fog of speculation is heavy today, and investors seem to be buying anything crypto-related on the hope a new presidential administration will make more favorable policy decisions. But most tokens themselves haven't been restricted in the U.S. -- it's what companies can do on the blockchain to sell assets or build businesses that have been in a gray area. So, if there are changes to the regulatory environment, I'm not sure tokens like Bitcoin will be the beneficiaries like they are today. I think it's much more likely that blockchain infrastructure and stablecoins will do well, which is why Coinbase is the one stock I'm bullish on here. There's a lot of innovation to be unlocked on the blockchain, and Coinbase has the stablecoin (USDC), blockchain (Base), trading platform, and other services for developers and business owners to make real businesses here. That's where I think there will be true innovation over the next decade, not in tokens moving up and down. But today, that's all the market is thinking about.

MSTR,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why.

MSTR,"Crypto-Related Investments Surge on Trump Win, MicroStrategy Buy. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images. Investments tied to cryptocurrencies surged as the excitement over Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election continued. Bitcoin traded at yet another all-time high, surpassing $82,000. MicroStrategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin, announced it had just paid $2.03 billion to purchase another 27,200 bitcoin. The cryptocurrency euphoria that followed Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election continued Monday, with everything tied to the digital currency industry powering ahead. Bitcoin once again traded at an all-time high, surpassing $82,000. Dogecoin, a favorite of Trump adviser and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, surged 12%. Shares of companies in the sector, including Robinhood Markets (HOOD), Coinbase Global (COIN), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital parent MARA Holdings (MARA), soared 11% or better. Crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), also jumped. The enthusiasm has been driven by Trump's previous comments about his support of cryptocurrencies, at one point saying he wants the U.S. to be ""the crypto capital of the planet."".

BTC-USD,"Bitcoin reaches record high of $87,000 as crypto, Trump trades dominate stock market. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reached a record high on Monday, trading just shy of $87,000 and pushing several names in the stock market tied to the crypto trade and the post-election Trump rally higher to start the week. Coinbase (COIN), which offers cryptocurrency trading on its platform, was up more than 19% Monday and has now soared about 74% in the past five trading sessions. Similarly, Robinhood (HOOD), which also facilitates crypto trading, saw its stock rise more than 7% Monday and is now up more than 35% across five days. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Robinhood legal chief Dan Gallagher is among a list of names being considered to lead the SEC under President-elect Donald Trump's administration. The surge in cryptocurrencies and related stocks has been a part of the post-election Trump trade, where areas of the market expected to benefit most from a Trump administration have rallied since the election on Nov. 6. It's unclear exactly what Trump's crypto policy will be, but leading into the election, bitcoin traded very closely with the betting odds for Trump to win, as he is expected to be a friend to the industry. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile."". ""We're completely thrilled that we got a new president who campaigned on crypto and keeping the US a leader in the technology,"" Coinbase chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told Yahoo Finance. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest bitcoin ETF, rose more than 13% Monday. Companies with bitcoin on their balance sheet have also seen a boost amid the Trump trade. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, were up more than 25% on Monday. From Oct. 31 to Nov. 10, MicroStrategy purchased approximately 27,200 bitcoins at an average price of $74,463, the company said in a release on Monday. Tesla (TSLA) shares have also skyrocketed since Trump's election win. While the company also owns some bitcoin, the roughly 42% move over the past five days in the stock — including a 9% push higher on Monday — has been attributed to CEO Elon Musk's relationship with Trump. Musk donated $132 million to Trump's campaign and was one of his most vocal surrogates during the final months of the campaign. A report from CNN on Sunday said Musk has been at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort Trump owns where the president-elect has been managing the transition, almost every day since election night.

BTC-USD,"Trump’s bitcoin superpower promise may help Nvidia: Tech investor. Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Digital assets such as bitcoin could be poised for greatness under Trump, with Wall Street wunderkind Nvidia (NVDA) in a good position to benefit. “I think there are a lot of ways that the government could show support for crypto over the next few months,” EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). “Trump’s talk about doing a strategic Bitcoin reserve is bullish as an underlying bid for that currency,” said Jackson. To that end, bitcoin topped $80,000 for the first time on Sunday as its bullish run post Election Day rages on. The price of bitcoin has rallied 15% in the past five days, according to Yahoo Finance data. While on the campaign trail, Trump did not shy away from expressing his enthusiasm for digital assets. He even promised to make the nation a crypto friendly place, forecasting the US could become the “crypto capital of the planet” at this year’s Bitcoin 2024 conference. The president-elect specifically called out a desire to make the country a bitcoin ""superpower."". Crypto will be a big topic at this year's Yahoo Finance Invest conference — register to attend here. Enter one of the original bitcoin mining plays, AI chip darling Nvidia. Jackson has been watching Nvidia and its evolution for the past seven or so years. Although Nvidia's powerful chips rose to fame in the gaming space, its products were also mission critical to the development of cryptocurrency in its early days. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to assist crypto miners due to their speed and efficiency. As the demand for crypto potentially picks up under Trump, it could fuel orders for Nvidia's latest computing chips, on top of its applications for AI and Tesla (TSLA) robots. “Bitcoin mining itself will probably make a comeback if crypto does take another leg up,” said Jackson. Jackson fancies Nvidia shares could more than double given its wide competitive advantages in chip development over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). It's a bullish view echoed by Jackson's peers at the likes of Bank of America. “Crypto is emerging as this alternative money class,” Jackson added. One challenge is bringing the currency to the masses in a tangible, digestible way. Jackson envisions support for the digital currency industry under the Trump administration that could include “promoting approvals for all kinds of ETFs.”. ""Getting those stocks approved by the SEC is obviously going to give people a lot more choices so they don’t have to just directly invest in crypto.”. However it plays out over the coming years, Jackson remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies overall. “[There’s] more fun ahead,” he said.

BTC-USD,"Bitcoin hits fresh record near $85,000 as investors keep cheering 'crypto president' Trump. Bitcoin climbed to a record of nearly $85,000 on Monday morning. Investors are celebrating Donald Trump's promise to enact crypto-friendly legislation. One analyst predicted the price could reach $100,000 by the end of the year. Donald Trump's election victory has turbocharged bitcoin's price momentum, sending the token to a record of nearly $85,000 on Monday. It reached an intraday high of $84,986.15. The all-time high highlights broad enthusiasm among crypto traders who are convinced that digital assets are headed for a boost under Trump. For some, such as Binance CEO Richard Teng, the president-elect's victory marks the start of a ""golden era"" for cryptocurrency. After all, Trump's campaign was never short on crypto-friendly proposals. The self-branded crypto president's administration is expected to overturn tight regulation, make the US a crypto hub, pass stablecoin legislation, and maybe even create a national bitcoin reserve. ""Crypto is now essentially legal in the US, marking a major turning point for the industry,"" Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, previously told Business Insider. These promises have helped bitcoin surge by more than 10% since Election Day. The token is up by 95% in the year to date. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered's head of FX research, sees more highs coming imminently. ""For me, given current momentum post-election, I think this means 90k becomes the next target, easily achievable ahead of November 29. And then 100k, easily achievable ahead of December 27,"" he said in written commentary. The rally hasn't been limited to bitcoin. Altcoins such as dogecoin and cardano have more than doubled since Trump's victory, though they remain well below their records. ""Although both coins look overbought on daily timeframes, they are being driven by FOMO and short squeeze, which promises more chaotic moves in the coming days,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, FXPro's chief market analyst, said. ""Perhaps now is the time to pick up altcoins."". Read the original article on Business Insider. Sign in to access your portfolio.",Optimistic
MARA,"MARA Stock Skyrockets 18% After Massive Expansion into Ohio's Bitcoin Mining Scene. MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) just sent its stock flying nearly 18% today after announcing a massive 372-megawatt boost to its compute capacity in Ohio. The company snagged two operational data centers with 222 megawatts of interconnect-approved capacity and is developing a 150-megawatt greenfield facility in Findlay. Translation? MARA just upped its owned and operated compute power by over 70%, setting itself up for a major leap toward its 2024 target of 50 exahashes per second (EH/s). Investors are eating this up, and for good reasonMARA is playing a long game, aiming to dominate the Bitcoin mining industry on cost and capacity. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with MARA. Salman Khan, MARA's CFO, didn't hold back on the numbers, calling the acquisitions a steal at $270,000 per megawattone of the lowest in the industry. This isn't just about adding capacity; we're slashing costs and taking control, he said, pointing out the potential for up to 50% operating cost reductions at the Hopedale facility. CEO Fred Thiel chimed in, saying the expansion diversifies MARA's footprint across multiple independent system operators (ISOs), ensuring no single jurisdiction has more than half of its compute power. With plans to fully energize these sites by 2025, MARA's making it clear they're in it to win it, and the market is catching on. This isn't just an operational winit's a strategic masterstroke. MARA now boasts nearly 1.5 gigawatts of total capacity, with 65% of it fully under their control. That's a big deal in an industry that lives and dies by efficiency. The cherry on top? MARA's positioning itself as the low-cost leader while leaning into greenfield developments to drive profitability.

MARA,"Why Analysts Are Bullish on MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) Stock. MARA Holdings (MARA) operates as a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner and as such it is a popular option to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without buying digital assets. For the company’s business model to work, MARA requires the price of Bitcoin to be substantially higher than its cost of approximately $56,000 to expand its profit margins. As such, the rise in the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s value is directly beneficial to the company’s financial performance. When the market price of Bitcoin increases beyond the miners’ production costs, they can sell their Bitcoin holdings at a higher margin, thereby increasing their profitability. Lower interest rates are likely to help risk assets such as Bitcoin. As such, MARA and other Bitcoin miners are likely to see their share prices rise in coming months. For this reason, I am bullish on MARA stock. MARA’s portfolio boasts over 250,000 Bitcoin mining machines that are owned and leased, which is one of the reasons I’m bullish on the stock. The firm’s diversification extends beyond Bitcoin mining. It also mines Kaspa, develops cooling technology for data centers, and has an energy harvesting business dedicated to utilizing excess power. MARA recently announced that it has secured a $200 million line of credit, which is collateralized by a portion of its Bitcoin holdings. The company said that it “may use the funds to capitalize on strategic opportunities and for other general corporate purposes.”. As the chart below indicates, MARA stock is down 25% this year. The company’s share price has been hurt by a halving event that took place this past April, which is when the available supply of Bitcoin, and the rewards for mining it, are reduced by 50%. Another reason to be bullish on MARA is that a rise in Bitcoin’s price could lead to improved earnings. As the company’s break-even point is set around a Bitcoin price of $56,000, any increase above this level could potentially result in a catch-up rally for MARA stock given its underperformance so far this year. According to analysts at Bernstein, the price of Bitcoin is expected to reach a cycle high of $200,000 by the year 2025. This bullish forecast is based on a model that takes into account factors such as increasing institutional adoption led by new ETFs and lower interest rates. Bitcoin miners retain the ability to diversify their revenue streams by venturing into the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Investors might find value in the underlying energy assets associated with these companies. Bernstein’s analysis shows that crypto miners are currently trading at a 90% discount compared to traditional data centers when evaluated on a dollar-per-megawatt basis. Analysts are also bullish on MARA stock. MARA Holdings is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world with an installed hash rate of 36.9 EH/S. According to analysts, Marathon Digital’s approach to Bitcoin mining has evolved, transitioning from relying on third-party hosting to focusing on owning and operating its own infrastructure. Many analysts remain bullish on MARA stock. H.C. Wainwright analyst Kevin Dede recently reiterated a Buy rating and $27 price target on the shares. He took note of the company’s recent initiatives to position it “at the forefront of integrating digital asset computing with sustainable energy solutions and advanced technological applications.”. MARA stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among eight Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on four Buy, three Hold, and one Sell recommendations made in the last three months. The average MARA price target of $20.71 implies 17.80% upside from current levels. Read more analyst ratings on MARA stock. MARA Holdings is a Bitcoin miner whose profitability depends on Bitcoin’s price exceeding its $56,000 production cost. The company’s operations benefit from rising Bitcoin prices as it boosts margins by selling mined coins. Given my expectations that Bitcoin’s price will rise in the near-term, the company’s stock seems well-positioned to outperform. For this reason, I remain bullish on MARA stock.

SOFI,"Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) is a Great Choice. Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. SoFi Technologies, Inc. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>. In order to see if SOFI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For SOFI, shares are up 0.45% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is down 0.52% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 37.49% compares favorably with the industry's 6.5% performance as well. Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of SoFi Technologies, Inc. Have increased 78.67% over the past quarter, and have gained 61.56% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 13.52% and 37.4%, respectively. Investors should also take note of SOFI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, SOFI is averaging 63,361,096 shares for the last 20 days. The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SOFI. Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SOFI's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.09 to $0.12 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SOFI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep SoFi Technologies, Inc. On your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SOFI,"SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI): A Bull Case Theory. We came across a bullish thesis on SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) on Capitalist Letters’ Substack by Oguz Erkan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SOFI. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI)'s share was trading at $11.81 as of Nov 6th. SOFI’s trailing and forward P/E were 98.42 and 56.18 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A businessperson checking their laptop, highlighting the company's integration of technology across its banking and financial services. SoFi has once again delivered a standout quarterly performance, reporting EPS of $0.05, surpassing the estimate of $0.04, and revenue of $689 million, roughly 10% higher than the consensus forecast of $633 million. Despite these results, the stock has seen a nearly 8% drop following the announcement, a reaction not uncommon for SoFi, which has often experienced price pullbacks after significant gains. This recent decline follows a 30% stock rally in the month prior to earnings, indicating a pattern of heightened market expectations and subsequent correction. In the months leading up to this quarter, SoFi has shown steady improvement in both revenue and profitability. Since CEO Anthony Noto took the helm, the company has undergone a strategic evolution from a private lender into a full-scale fintech platform, now functioning as a vertically integrated financial services provider with a bank charter. In Q1 2023, SoFi’s balance sheet held approximately $15 billion in unsecured personal loans, which had fueled investor apprehension, particularly as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes intensified. Many investors feared SoFi might face elevated default risks similar to those seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, SoFi’s portfolio has proven resilient, with borrowers averaging annual incomes above $150,000 and FICO scores over 740, metrics that have helped alleviate concerns over credit quality. Additionally, SoFi adheres to strict lending standards, not extending credit to individuals with FICO scores below 680. As of Q1 2023, SoFi’s annualized charge-off rate was just 2.7%, showcasing strong loan performance relative to market fears. Throughout 2023, Noto has publicly underscored his disappointment with SoFi’s stock performance, given the company’s strong operational metrics. In response to investor concerns regarding its loan portfolio, SoFi shared data during its Q2 2024 earnings report showing that the Q4 2022 loan vintage was performing about 20% better than the 2017 vintage, which had come closest to experiencing higher loan losses. Since then, SoFi’s later vintages have continued to perform well, strengthening confidence in the business. This quarter, SoFi saw a marked rebound, as the market began to recognize the business’s underlying strength, particularly as interest rate cuts appeared on the horizon. This quarter’s results confirmed SoFi’s strategic shift from lending toward a diversified fintech model. For the third consecutive quarter, SoFi has demonstrated its progress in revenue mix, with financial services and tech platform revenue comprising 49% of total revenue in Q3 2024, up from 39% a year ago. SoFi’s continued growth in non-lending revenue streams highlights its resilience in an unpredictable economic environment and shows its commitment to scaling a robust, diversified financial services business. The quarter brought impressive member growth as well, with SoFi adding 750,000 new members, representing a 35% increase year-over-year and reaching nearly 9.4 million members. In addition, the company added 1.1 million new products this quarter, pushing its total product count to nearly 13.7 million, up 31% year-over-year. SoFi’s tech platform revenue, a critical part of its transformation, grew 14% year-over-year and generated $30 million in operating income. SoFi’s financial services business has also been integral in building operational leverage. The segment’s revenue doubled from $118 million to $238 million year-over-year, with non-interest income making up more than 35% of total financial services revenue, up from 26% a year ago. Despite doubling revenue, expenses for this segment only rose by 20%, reflecting significant operating leverage and SoFi’s strategy to transition to fee-based revenue, which further strengthens the business’s profitability. Another area of exceptional growth has been SoFi’s capital-light lending platform, which grew fivefold this quarter. In Q3, SoFi originated $1 billion in loans on behalf of third parties, generating $61.1 million in revenue through loan generation fees and servicing cash flow. This approach highlights SoFi’s ongoing effort to pivot away from legacy lending by emphasizing capital-light revenue channels. However, with rates expected to stabilize, SoFi remains well-positioned to increase lending activity strategically, balancing risk and profitability. CEO Anthony Noto’s strategy of underpromising and overdelivering has solidified SoFi’s position as a leader in fintech innovation. SoFi’s revenue mix has shifted dramatically in recent quarters, signaling its transformation into a technology-driven financial platform. Today, SoFi stands at the cusp of becoming a “pure-play” fintech company, with financial services and tech platform revenue nearing a majority of its total revenue. SoFi’s strong Q3 results and effective business evolution underscore its position as a high-growth fintech with a well-diversified revenue base and capable management. The company’s momentum points to significant growth potential, with room for the market to increasingly value its resilient business model and diverse revenue streams. Despite impressive recent performance, SoFi remains attractively priced. Revenue guidance for 2024 stands at $2.5 billion, with an EBITDA target of $645 million, supported by 30% year-over-year growth. Assuming conservative growth rates of 15% in revenue and 25% in EBITDA, SoFi’s 2029 revenue could reach $5.3 billion, with EBITDA at $2 billion, valuing the company at just 2x 2029 sales and 5x EBITDA. Notably, management is forecasting 26% revenue growth next year and aims for $0.5 EPS by 2026, equating to only 20x 2026 earnings. This favorable valuation, even after recent gains, highlights an appealing investment opportunity. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

SOFI,"Prediction: SoFi Stock Will Double by 2026. Investors are getting excited about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) stock again. The fintech superstar lost market confidence earlier this year as its lending business came under pressure from interest rates, but it has continued to gain traction as a real alternative to the big, traditional banks. Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto is confident that SoFi will become one of the 10 biggest banks in the country. ""It's a matter of when, not if,"" he said in the company's third-quarter earnings remarks. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». SoFi has been reporting outstanding progress, and trends are starting to work in its favor. Here are three reasons SoFi stock could double by 2026. One thing SoFi hasn't had any problems with since going public in 2021 is growing. Its revenue has increased by at least 20% for 17 consecutive quarters and under all kinds of circumstances, including a pandemic, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations. It accelerated to 30% in the 2024 third quarter, as the economy looks like it's beginning to stabilize. The growth is coming from multiple places. SoFi continues to attract new members at high rates, and these customers are increasing engagement and adding more products. New members increased 35% in the third quarter, and products increased 31%. But it's more than that. Existing customers were responsible for 32% of the new products, and 20% of new members opted for a second product within 30 days of becoming a customer. This is likely to continue. Management pointed out research from Mintel that shows that 20% of Americans are looking for a new savings account, and an equal percentage of people are looking for a new credit card. Then there are all the other financial services people are looking for that SoFi offers, such as checking accounts and investing solutions. Each time someone signs up and is happy, it's an opportunity to establish its brand and benefit from recommendations. It's a strong flywheel effect with huge long-term implications, so don't be surprised if SoFi gets into the top 10 in the coming years. Management has worked to transform SoFi from a student loan specialist into a full financial services app focusing on capital-light, fee-based products. Fee-based revenue increased 65% year over year in the third quarter and accounted for a quarter of total adjusted revenue, and that's resulting in rising profitability. The all-digital setup, without expensive real estate and human interaction, also lends itself to profitability at scale. All three of SoFi's segments -- lending, financial services, and tech platform -- were profitable in the third quarter. The lending segment has been under pressure this year due to high interest rates, but it's already getting better, and management revised its outlook, saying the lending business will match 2023's results rather than coming in below. The nonlending segments keep growing as a percentage of the total business, reaching 49% in the third quarter, up from 39% last year. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.05 beat expectations of $0.04 in the third quarter, and management raised its forecast across the board, increasing its EPS estimate from about $0.09 to $0.10 to about $0.11 to $0.12 and revenue growth from 18% to 22%. The situation looks positive for SoFi right now, but could its stock really double? Right now, SoFi stock trades at a forward, one-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52. I wouldn't call that cheap, but it's reasonable for a company reporting this kind of performance. Keeping that constant, SoFi's stock doubling would mean earnings doubling by the end of 2026, too. The average Wall Street analyst expects $0.12 in EPS this year, and then for that to more than double to $0.28 next year. If it keeps up that kind of earnings growth, it the stock price could easily double its price without becoming relatively more expensive. There are so many factors that could affect how SoFi moves, but if the loan segment strengthens with lower interest rates while it cranks out more high growth, it should sustain positive market sentiment.

SOFI,"Is Trending Stock SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) a Buy Now? SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +31.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which SoFi Technologies falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, SoFi Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share, indicating a change of +100% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +21.7% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.12 points to a change of +133.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +21%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.29 indicates a change of +141.9% from what SoFi Technologies is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.9%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for SoFi Technologies. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:. While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. For SoFi Technologies, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $664.31 million indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $2.53 billion and $3 billion estimates indicate +21.9% and +18.7% changes, respectively. SoFi Technologies reported revenues of $689.45 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. EPS of $0.05 for the same period compares with -$0.03 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $637.32 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.18%. The EPS surprise was +25%. Over the last four quarters, SoFi Technologies surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. SoFi Technologies is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about SoFi Technologies. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RIOT,"Riot Platforms (RIOT): Leading Bitcoin Mining with Strategic Acquisitions and Robust Growth. We recently published a list of 7 Most Profitable Cryptocurrency Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) stands against other most profitable cryptocurrency stocks to invest in. Bitcoin recently bounced back to the $62,000 level in the week ended October 11. Simultaneously, Ether jumped 1.73% to $2,443 and Solana climbed 4.23% to $144. The weekly performance reflected a quiet crypto market with Bitcoin slightly dipping while Ether and Solana inching up by less than 1%. Amidst changing interest rates, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire discussed the impact on the stablecoin market in an interview with CNBC. In his opinion, the Federal Reserve changes interest rates as a tool to either increase or lower or to take a neutral position with respect to the velocity of money in the economy. According to the general view, lower interest rates are better for the markets as the cost of capital becomes less. He considers lower interest rates as a really good thing for a stablecoin issuer like Circle as more capital will be put to work and so the velocity of money will increase and so will the demand for stablecoin money. Apart from the interest rates, positive news for the crypto industry has come after almost 2 years of the crypto exchange FTX collapse. According to the firm, former customers are to recover a sum worth nearly 119% of what their accounts had at the bankruptcy time. Regarding this, FTX’s current chief executive John. J. Ray III stated that:. “Looking ahead, we are poised to return 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors through what will be the largest and most complex bankruptcy estate asset distribution in history”. With the upcoming 2024 election, the crypto world continues to look forward to what the candidates say about digital currency. After formerly railing against cryptocurrencies, Trump has embraced crypto as he announced the launch of a crypto banking platform World Liberty Financial. He has also expressed support for domestic Bitcoin miners saying that if crypto is going to define the future, he wants it to be mined, minted, and made in the US. Many crypto enthusiasts are also welcoming Kamala Harris’s viewpoint on the topic. Harris said she would encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets during a fundraiser at Cipriani Wall Street. Commenting on this pro-crypto statement, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap Hayden Adams, posted on X: “I believe this is her first time referencing crypto publicly and it’s in a positive way.”. Simultaneously, venture capitalist Ben Horowitz has decided to make a significant donation to Harris’s campaign. This move was a reversal from the previous when he and his business partner Marc Andreessen initially backed President Trump. In an internal letter reported by CNBC, Horowitz says that he has spoken to Harris regarding tech policies and believes that although Harris hasn’t revealed her intentions yet, he is hopeful about her administration being much better than the Biden administration which has been destructive to tech policy, especially crypto and AI. Our Methodology:. In order to compile a list of the 7 most profitable cryptocurrency stocks to invest in, we created an initial list of 30 companies with the biggest market caps in the sector.

Riot also bolstered its growth profile by acquiring the Kentucky Bitcoin miner Block Mining.

RIOT,"Why Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) is the Most Promising Stock to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we will look at the 8 Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts. Let’s look at where Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) stands against other promising stocks according to Wall Street analysts. With only a few days left until the 2024 presidential election, investors are preparing for potential volatility to shake the stock market. Uncertainty surrounds the winner of the November elections, whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will take. With around 62% of US adults invested in the stock markets, there are potentially particular ways for investors to manage and position their portfolios to reach profitability based on the election outcome, as there are differences in the Democratic and Republican economic policies. However, despite this uncertainty, geopolitical tensions are already influencing market reactions. Tiffany McGhee, CEO and CIO at Pivotal Advisors, highlighted the potential macro events that could spark market volatility at the start of October. She was of the opinion that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the vice presidential debate are critical factors influencing market reactions. Bond prices experienced a decline earlier in the week but stabilized with investors looking for safety amidst the worsening geopolitical tensions. McGhee expects further short-term volatility as the elections approach due to these developments. So, what should investors do to combat this volatility and ensure their profitability? McGhee prompted investors to reassess their portfolios, especially those with a heavy concentration in equities. With the S&P 500 up 20% year-to-date and sectors like consumer discretionary and technology performing on the better end of the spectrum, she suggests that this might be the time to take some profits off the table and think about reallocating these funds into different areas of the market to follow trends. Market volatility and geopolitical trends are pushing investors to speculate about the most promising and high-growth sectors. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to talk about what his expectations from the market are. With earning expectations revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digits, solid growth is expected as 2024 draws to a close. According to Buchanan, much of this growth is expected to come from artificial intelligence. In addition, expanding earnings growth beyond traditional growth in certain other sectors, like technology, is also anticipated to drive growth. The energy and industrial sectors have experienced greater returns in 2024, capturing a significant portion of the market. Apart from value stocks and AI plays, Buchanan also adds that names in industrials, consumer discretionary, and financials are on the path to growth ahead for 2024. However, his advice to investors is prudent: to consider geopolitical events before diving head-first into investment decisions. The stock market is thus exhibiting signs of its changing trends. Some of these are paving a profitable path for small caps. We discussed the potential of small-caps to rally in our article 7 Penny Stocks with Low PE Ratios. Here is an excerpt from it:. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, recently appeared in a CNBC interview and is of the opinion that the current market is precisely what a soft landing looks like. Talking about how lower interest rates are expected to benefit small caps, particularly the Russell 2000, Adam said that he believes the bull market will continue with the economy inching closer to a soft landing. Our Methodology. We used the Finviz screener to make a list of 25 mid cap stocks with a market cap of over $2 billion and selected the 30% above price column in the target price section. We picked the top 8 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 9, 2024. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment around the stocks, as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 8 Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts.

Its future growth plans are fully funded due to its continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. The company announced the acquisition of Block Mining at the close of Q2. Block Mining is a privately held miner that operates in Kentucky.

RIOT,"According to Analysts, Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) Is Set for Significant Growth with 129.30% Upside Potential. We recently published a list of 7 Most Undervalued Blockchain Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Riot Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) stands against the other most undervalued blockchain stocks to buy according to analysts. The blockchain industry is witnessing significant trends that are shaping its future and expanding its use cases across various sectors. One of the most notable trends is the growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which is transforming traditional financial systems by providing peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains without intermediaries. Established financial institutions are increasingly adopting blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global market for blockchain in banking and financial services was valued at $4.61 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand significantly at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.4% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $27.69 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the 2024 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report by Chainalysis, an American blockchain analysis firm, global crypto activity is on the rise. Between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, the total value of global crypto activity increased significantly to surpass levels seen in 2021 during the crypto bull market. In January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. This approval led to a surge in Bitcoin activity across all regions, particularly in institutional-sized transfers and in regions with higher-income countries like North America and Western Europe. Meanwhile, stablecoin usage saw higher growth among retail and professional transfers, especially in lower-income areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The Geography of Cryptocurrency Report also shows that DeFi services have seen substantial year-over-year growth, especially in areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Crypto investing is becoming more mainstream and institutionalized with Bitcoin ETFs. However, blockchain technology and tokenization also have the potential to disrupt the traditional ETF model. On September 28, CNBC reported that Janus Henderson, a leading global asset management group, has announced a partnership with Anemoy Limited and Centrifuge to launch the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund (LTF), a tokenized fund that provides investors direct access to short-term US Treasury bills. Nick Cherney, head of innovation at Janus Henderson, emphasized that this development represents an evolution in delivering investment services to clients more efficiently rather than a threat to the ETF industry. This new fund will retain the typical features of an ETF while enabling trading on a blockchain platform. This offers investors benefits like 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and enhanced transparency regarding fund holdings, surpassing what traditional ETFs provide. Cherney stated that the firm aims to be at the forefront of this opportunity, which reflects a broader trend of integrating blockchain into financial services. These trends highlight the growing interest in blockchain technology and its potential to reshape financial systems worldwide. Methodology. To compile our list of the 7 most undervalued blockchain stocks to buy according to analysts, we reviewed our own rankings, sifted through ETFs, and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of over 30 stocks involved in the blockchain space, we focused on those trading at under 23 times their forward earnings as of October 4. This helped us identify stocks that are cheaper than the S&P 500 Index, which has a forward P/E of 23.6 as of October 4 (as per WSJ). We included only those stocks that are estimated to have positive earnings growth this year. From this list, we selected the stocks that analysts believe possess the greatest potential for growth. Finally, we ranked the 7 most undervalued blockchain stocks to buy according to analysts based on their average price target upside potential as of October 4, 2024. Additionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

RIOT,"Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT) Positioned to Leverage AI Energy and GPU Demand; Roth MKM Maintains Buy Rating with $20 Target. We recently compiled a list of the 20 Hidden Gem AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) stands against the other hidden gem AI stocks. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) businesses has loomed large over finance markets in the past few months, pushing investor attention away from other topics. This is because AI-enabled breakthroughs are creating new areas of focus for investors and disrupting major industries. Some of the major themes in this regard include AI-powered systems for environmental monitoring, ethical discussions surrounding the role of AI in healthcare, and the continued evolution of large language models. For example, tech giant Microsoft recently led the development of an AI system capable of predicting air pollution on a global scale. This system generates real-time, hyperlocal pollution forecasts, using data from satellites and ground sensors. The breakthrough could prove crucial for public health, especially in densely populated areas that suffer from poor air quality. The implications of this development extend beyond environmental health to improving policy decisions worldwide. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Some important numbers illustrate this revolution in action. The global AI market was valued at around $208 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 37% from 2024 to 2030 (as per estimates from Statista)?. According to recent surveys, about 35% of businesses are already using AI in some form, while another 42% are exploring its potential for future integration. Most of the AI usage is focused on process automation, customer insights, and data analysis. Hyperscalers are leading the innovation in this regard with multi-billion-dollar investments in AI data centers around the world. AI is also projected to both create and displace jobs. By 2025, AI is expected to displace 85 million jobs globally but create 97 million new roles, according to the World Economic Forum. These new jobs will primarily focus on AI development, machine learning, and AI governance?. Investors should closely monitor these emerging trends to stay ahead of the curve and place their bets accordingly.

For this article, we selected AI stocks that do not receive much coverage from financial media or Wall Street analysts, but have AI-related operations and opportunities that are worthy of investor attention. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A computer engineer working in a futuristic office, programming algorithms to mine cryptocurrency. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12. Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) operates as a bitcoin mining company in North America. Although not directly involved in the AI business, the company still has tremendous value in the AI universe through the energy and GPU markets. As a miner of digital coins, the firm uses an extensive amount of energy to keep machines running, and has developed a business selling the excess energy it does not need. As AI data centers come online, Riot could use them as potential customers in this regard. In addition, it also has an extensive GPU system, which are also used in AI data centers, and Riot could repurpose these machines for AI tasks and become a valuable partner to AI firms in desperate need of GPUs. Roth MKM recently maintained a Buy rating and $20 price target on Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock after the company's September bitcoin production data saw 28% sequential increase for the month. Riot's hash rate increased to about 28.2 EH/s following new machine installations and the company also improved operational uptime by 69%, the advisory detailed in a research note. Riot Platforms remains one of the best options for investors seeking pure-play BTC mining exposure, the advisory added. Overall RIOT ranks 11th on our list of the hidden gem AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of RIOT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

LCID,"Lucid reports better-than-expected Q3 results; Gravity SUV on track for late 2024 production. Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors (LCID) reported a third quarter revenue beat and narrower-than-expected loss as the company gears up for the all-important release of its Gravity electric SUV. For the quarter, Lucid reported revenue of $200 million, topping estimates of $196.3 million as compiled by Bloomberg and significantly more than the $137.8 million reported a year ago. Lucid posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.28, narrower than the loss of $0.31 expected, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coming in at a loss of $613.1 million, better than the loss of $634.4 million expected. Earlier, Lucid reported it had produced 1,805 vehicles in Q3, with deliveries coming in at 2,781. The company said today that it was on track to hit its annual production guidance of 9,000 vehicles. Lucid stock was up 3% in early trade on Friday. “Our momentum continues with our third consecutive quarter of record deliveries,” Peter Rawlinson, Lucid CEO and chief technology officer, said in a statement. “Additionally, today we are delighted to open the order book for the much-anticipated Lucid Gravity SUV, a landmark product, which remains on track for the start of production this year."". The company also said it ended the quarter with $5.16 billion in cash — an important runway as the company begins production of the Gravity. This does not include the approximately $1.75 billion it raised in a share sale earlier last month. “We continue to see improvements to gross margin performance as our cost reduction efforts are gaining momentum,” said Gagan Dhingra, Lucid’s interim CFO, in a statement. “With our recent capital raise, we are pleased to have the continued support once again from both the Public Investment Fund and other institutional investors.”. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), through its affiliate Ayar Third Investment Company, is Lucid’s largest investor. Ayar purchased additional shares during the capital raise to maintain its 58.8% stake. Lucid hopes its upcoming Gravity SUV, expected to begin production later this year, will jump-start sales by a significant margin. “We believe that the total addressable market for Gravity is six times that of Lucid Air,” Rawlinson said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in August. Rawlinson said the company will eventually have capacity at its Arizona plant to build 90,000 Gravity SUVs per year. The big question will be whether Lucid can build the Gravity SUV efficiently and come in below cost. The Gravity is expected to start around $80,000 in the US, right at the eligibility threshold for the federal EV tax credit. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

MPWR,"Monolithic Power Systems’s (NASDAQ:MPWR) Q3 Sales Top Estimates But Stock Drops. Power management chips maker Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q3 CY2024, with sales up 30.6% year on year to $620.1 million. The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $610 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $4.06 per share was also 2.3% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Monolithic Power Systems? Find out in our full research report. Revenue: $620.1 million vs analyst estimates of $600.4 million (3.3% beat). Adjusted EPS: $4.06 vs analyst estimates of $3.97 (2.3% beat). Adjusted Operating Income: $220.8 million vs analyst estimates of $215.6 million (2.4% beat). Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $610 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting. Gross Margin (GAAP): 55.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. Inventory Days Outstanding: 140, down from 171 in the previous quarter. Operating Margin: 26.5%, down from 28.5% in the same quarter last year. Market Capitalization: $45.5 billion. “Our results continue to demonstrate the success of our proven, long-term growth strategy and our transformation from being only a chip supplier to a full solutions provider,” said Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS. Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption. Demand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years. A company’s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Monolithic Power Systems grew its sales at an incredible 27.1% compounded annual growth rate. This is a great starting point for our analysis because it shows Monolithic Power Systems’s offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy). We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Monolithic Power Systems’s annualized revenue growth of 10.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong. This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 30.6%, and its $620.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.3%. Management is currently guiding for a 34.4% year-on-year increase next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 24% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is commendable and indicates the market believes its newer products and services will spur faster growth. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems’s DIO came in at 140, which is 24 days below its five-year average. At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup. We were impressed by Monolithic Power Systems’s strong improvement in inventory levels. We were also excited its revenue and operating profit outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, revenue and operating profit guidance were in line with expectations. Perhaps the market was expecting more, especially for guidance given the strong quarter. Shares traded down 6.4% to $860 immediately following the results. Is Monolithic Power Systems an attractive investment opportunity at the current price?The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

PLTR,"Analysts adjust Palantir stock ratings as valuation soars. Claude Shannon had a simple way of looking at life. ""I just wondered how things were put together,"" he once said. Related: Analysts overhaul Palantir stock price target after Q3 earnings. That sense of wonder inspired the mathematician and computer scientist to invent a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube, flame-throwing trumpets, rocket-powered Frisbees, and plastic foam shoes for navigating a lake that made the wearer seem to be walking on water. And, oh, yeah, Shannon, who won the Nobel Prize in 1939, was also the first person to describe the Boolean gates that are essential to all digital electronic circuits. And he was one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence. ???? Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter ????. Put that in your flame-throwing trumpet and smoke it. Shannon's impact on the Information Age has been so profound that AI-research company Anthropic decided to name its family of large language models Claude in his honor. Anthropic and data-analytics company Palantir Technologies (PLTR) announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AMZN) to provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to the Claude 3 and 3.5 family of models on AWS. The two companies said the partnership enables an integrated technology suite to implement the use of Claude within Palantir’s AI Platform while leveraging the security, agility, flexibility and sustainability benefits provided by AWS. Bloomberg&sol;Getty Images. Claude became accessible within Palantir's platform on AWS earlier this month. Palantir, recently added to the S&P 500, has established itself as a key player in the defense industry, with a host of contracts with domestic and international agencies that focus on its data-analytics and AI technologies. Related: Veteran trader makes surprising call between Palantir, Nvidia stock. The Denver company, founded by the tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, is also seeing rapid growth in its commercial division. “Our partnership with Anthropic and AWS provides U.S. defense and intelligence communities the tool chain they need to harness and deploy AI models securely, bringing the next generation of decision advantage to their most critical missions,” Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, said in a statement. Palantir has been on a tear lately. The company’s stock has more than tripled (up 232%) year-to-date and have soared 203% from a year ago. They touched a fresh high on Nov. 5 following a blowout earnings report. Palantir also boosted its full-year revenue forecast for the third time this year, thanks in part to outsized gains from its nonmilitary business. ""We are building this company, and we believe we're at the beginning,"" Chief Executive Alex Karp told analysts during Palantir's earnings call. ""Despite great skepticism about our view of how to do this, the market seems to have decided [that] what works works."". Some investment firms have raised concerns about Palantir's high-flying valuation and adjusted their ratings on the company's shares. Analysts at Argus downgraded Palantir to hold from buy on Nov. 7, according to The Fly. The company has been dramatically improving its profitability and cash flow over the past year, the investment firm said, but the shares have about tripled in value this year and might be getting ahead of what the fundamentals can support. Palantir also specializes in catering to a small segment of organizations with highly complex IT challenges, which could lead to uneven results that the market tends to punish in highly valued tech stocks, Argus added. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill downgraded Palantir to underperform (effectively sell) from hold, affirming its price target at $28. The firm said that Palantir trading at 38 times estimated 2025 revenue makes it the most expensive software name while insider selling through 10b5-1 plans has picked up. The Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b5-1 enables stock trades to be scheduled in advance by public companies' officers or directors to avoid accusations of insider trading, according to Investopedia. The company's fundamentals ""are alive,"" but it would have to accelerate growth to 40% for four years straight and trade at 12 times estimated 2028 revenue ""just to hold its stock price, which seems unlikely,"" Thill said.

As such, Thill downgraded Palantir on the ""unsustainable valuation"" and said he is awaiting a better entry point. TheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle, on the other hand, was feeling all kinds of love for Palantir. In fact, Guilfoyle, whose career goes back to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in the 1980s, raised his price target for the company's shares just two days after his previous target boost. ""I wrote to you on Tuesday in response to [Palantir's] glorious quarterly earnings report and marvelous guidance provided,"" he wrote on Nov. 8. ""In that piece, I increased our target price from $48 to $56. Well, it only took from Tuesday until Thursday for PLTR to trade at $56."". The veteran trader lifted his latest price target on Palantir to $70, ""just so we don't end up selling shares more quickly than we can add them back on."". ""That does become a problem when a core holding refuses to consolidate,"" he added. Guilfoyle was feeling less-than-charitable toward Thill and Monness analyst Brian White, who reiterated his sell target on Palantir with an $18 target. ""Don't let the guys rattle you,"" he told his readers. ""They both are long-time PLTR bears and have been wrong every step of the way. Neither of these analysts has had anything better than a 'hold' rating on PLTR at any point this year."". ""In short, when it comes to this name, you and I have absolutely schooled these two, who just can't seem to get out of their own way,"" Guilfoyle added.

BTC-USD,"Why Bitcoin's Record Price Rally May Be Choked Between $90K and $100K? Deribit-listed BTC options at $90,000 and $100,000 strikes have been sold to dealers, according to Amberdata. The rally may lose steam if prices reach those levels. As bitcoin's {{BTC}} ongoing price surge gives off an aura of invincibility, one force threatens to slow the ascent above $90,000, potentially keeping the cryptocurrency rangebound above the said price level. The force is of market makers or dealers – entities responsible for providing liquidity to the order book, profiting from the bid-ask spread while constantly striving to maintain a market-neutral exposure. Those making the bitcoin options market on crypto exchange Deribit currently appear to have a significant positive ""gamma"" exposure at the $90,000 and $100,000 strike options. In simple terms, it means traders/investors have sold options at these levels, leaving market makers, who are always on the opposite side, with a large chunk of long positions. When market makers have long or positive gamma exposures, they tend to buy the underlying asset when its price is falling and sell on the rise to keep their net exposure direction neutral. This hedging acts as a volatility dampener, restricting price swings. In bitcoin's case, it means market makers will likely trade against the market direction between $90,000 and $100,000, thereby keeping prices rangebound, assuming other things being equal. ""We see a lot of traders owning [buying] optionality up to the $90K handle for Nov 29th and Dec 27th. But the $90k-$100k+ range has been sold to dealers,"" Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini, said. ""Should the market get there, we might see prices struggle, unless sentiment shifts further bullish,"" Magadini added. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and the put option confers the right to sell. Gamma is one of the critical options ""Greeks,"" measuring how much the price of an option accelerates when the underlying asset's price moves. The net gamma exposure determines how aggressively an options market maker needs to buy or sell the underlying asset to keep overall exposure neutral. Bitcoin is currently changing hands just above $82,000, just 8% away from the crucial $90,000 level, according to CoinDesk data. Sign in to access your portfolio.",Neutral
MARA,"MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) shareholders are still up 771% over 5 years despite pulling back 6.6% in the past week. It hasn't been the best quarter for MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time. But that does not change the realty that the stock's performance has been terrific, over five years. In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 771%. Impressive! So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one. Of course what matters most is whether the business can improve itself sustainably, thus justifying a higher price. While the returns over the last 5 years have been good, we do feel sorry for those shareholders who haven't held shares that long, because the share price is down 61% in the last three years. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance! While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for MARA Holdings. In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. During the last half decade, MARA Holdings became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). We know that MARA Holdings has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts. We're pleased to report that MARA Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 100% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 54% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - MARA Holdings has   4 warning signs  (and 2 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about. Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.

For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript. MARA Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) successfully acquired and closed the Garden City data center in Texas, enhancing their operational capacity. The company increased its 2024 hash rate target to 50 exahash, demonstrating a commitment to growth and expansion. MARA signed a significant partnership with the government of Kenya to develop underutilized energy assets, showcasing their focus on sustainable energy solutions. The launch of MARA's Kaspa mining operations has diversified revenue streams and achieved over 80% margins, contributing positively to financial performance. MARA's energy harvesting initiatives, such as the pilot heating project in Finland, highlight innovative approaches to utilizing digital asset compute for sustainable energy solutions. MARA reported a net loss of $200 million in the second quarter, significantly higher than the $9 million loss in the same period last year. Bitcoin production was impacted by unexpected equipment failures and transmission line maintenance, affecting operational efficiency. The company faced increased global hash rate and network difficulty, which, along with the April halving event, reduced bitcoin production. General and administrative expenses increased due to the growing scale of the business and acquisitions, impacting overall profitability. The volatility in bitcoin prices led to a significant loss on the fair market value of digital assets, affecting financial results. Q: Can you talk a little bit about your investment in Auradine and are you currently using any of their miners? A: We've disclosed in the 10-Q orders and payments to Auradine for orders of machines. We believe the Auradine 3 nanometer miners, which will begin shipments towards the back half of this year and into next year, are amongst the best in the industry. They have received positive feedback and are considered a strong competitor to Bitmain. Q: With the announcement of your 100% HODL strategy of mined bitcoin, how do you plan to fund continuing operations? A: We have cash on the balance sheet and access to capital markets. Additionally, initiatives like Kaspa, which has high margins, and our technology businesses will result in additional cash flows. This strategy is not new to MARA, as we had a similar approach in 2021. Q: You have a number of initiatives ongoing. When can we expect them to contribute to revenue and earnings? A: We are focused on developing resilient businesses with long-term growth potential. Energy harvesting and technology businesses are expected to mine bitcoin at low costs and provide technology to other industries. These initiatives will contribute to revenue as they scale. Q: Can you explain the operational issues faced in the last two quarters and their likelihood of recurrence? A: The issues at the Ellendale site were mainly due to transformer failures and transmission line maintenance. Applied Digital has addressed these issues, and we have implemented strategies to prevent recurrence. We are working closely with hosting partners to mitigate such risks. Q: How do you evaluate the economics of mining versus edge AI work? A: We do not plan to operate AI inference at the edge but aim to provide infrastructure for it. Our immersion technology is designed for these areas, and we see opportunities to partner with industry leaders. We believe bitcoin mining can act as a load balancer for AI data centers.

SOFI,"Decoding SoFi Technologies Inc (SOFI): A Strategic SWOT Insight. SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) demonstrates robust growth with a 30% increase in total net revenue year-over-year. Net income shifts from a significant loss to a positive gain, indicating a strong turnaround in profitability. Despite impressive growth, SoFi faces challenges in noninterest expenses and competitive market threats. Opportunities for expansion and innovation are ripe, given the company's technological capabilities and market trends. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SOFI. SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI), a pioneering force in the financial-services sector, has recently submitted its 10-Q filing on November 7, 2024, revealing a financial landscape marked by significant growth and strategic advancements. The company's financial tables from the filing indicate a 30% year-over-year increase in total net revenue, climbing from $537.21 million to $697.12 million. This growth is further underscored by a remarkable shift in net income, which has turned from a loss of $266.68 million in the previous year to a positive $60.74 million, signaling a strong turnaround in profitability. These figures reflect SoFi's successful expansion of its product offerings and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities. However, the company's noninterest expenses, although reduced by 21% from the previous year, still pose a challenge to its operational efficiency. As SoFi continues to navigate the competitive landscape of digital financial services, it must leverage its strengths while addressing inherent weaknesses and threats, and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead. Financial Performance and Diversified Revenue Streams: SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) has exhibited a commendable financial performance, as evidenced by the 30% increase in total net revenue and a significant turnaround from a net loss to a net gain. The company's diversified revenue streams, which include interest income from loans and securitizations, noninterest income from loan origination, sales, and technology products, have contributed to this growth. The ability to generate revenue from multiple sources not only demonstrates SoFi's adaptability but also provides a buffer against market volatility. Technological Edge and Innovation: SoFi's acquisition of Galileo and Technisys, along with its in-house technological advancements, have positioned the company as a leader in digital financial services. The company's technology platform segment, which offers a suite of services including cloud-native digital banking and AI-driven payment fraud mitigation, has seen a revenue increase, indicating strong demand and potential for future growth. SoFi's commitment to innovation is a significant strength that enables it to stay ahead of the competition and meet evolving consumer needs. Noninterest Expenses: Despite a reduction in noninterest expenses, SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) still faces challenges in managing these costs effectively. High expenses in technology and product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative areas can impact the company's bottom line. It is crucial for SoFi to continue streamlining operations and optimizing resource allocation to improve profitability and operational efficiency. Dependence on Market Conditions: SoFi's performance, particularly in its lending operations, is susceptible to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and economic cycles. Fluctuations in these conditions can affect loan origination volumes, credit quality, and the demand for financial products. This dependence on external factors is a weakness that requires strategic management and proactive risk mitigation. Market Expansion: SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) has the opportunity to expand its market presence both domestically and internationally. The company's technological capabilities and comprehensive financial services offerings position it well to capture a larger share of the growing digital banking and fintech sectors. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions, like the recent purchase of Wyndham, a fintech mortgage lender, can further enhance SoFi's market reach and product portfolio. Product Innovation: The financial services industry is rapidly evolving, with increasing consumer demand for digital and personalized financial solutions. SoFi's strong technological foundation allows it to innovate and introduce new products that cater to these changing preferences. By leveraging data analytics and AI, SoFi can develop tailored financial planning tools and investment products that resonate with a tech-savvy customer base. Regulatory Changes: The financial services industry is highly regulated, and changes in laws or regulations can have a significant impact on SoFi's operations. The company must navigate a complex regulatory landscape, which includes compliance with banking regulations, consumer protection laws, and data privacy standards. Any adverse regulatory developments could impose additional compliance costs or limit SoFi's business activities. Competitive Landscape: SoFi operates in a highly competitive environment with traditional banks, fintech startups, and other non-banking financial institutions vying for market share. The company must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain a competitive edge. Intense competition can also lead to pricing pressures and increased customer acquisition costs, which can affect profitability. In conclusion, SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) has demonstrated strong financial growth and possesses a solid technological foundation that positions it well in the competitive financial services landscape. However, the company must address its noninterest expense management and remain vigilant of market dependencies. With opportunities for market expansion and product innovation, SoFi is poised to further solidify its market position, provided it navigates regulatory challenges and competitive threats effectively. The company's forward-looking strategies, including leveraging its strengths and addressing weaknesses, will be crucial in sustaining growth and profitability in the dynamic financial sector.

RIOT,"Institutions profited after Riot Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:RIOT) market cap rose US$249m last week but individual investors profited the most. Significant control over Riot Platforms by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions. 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders. Recent sales by insiders. Every investor in Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 48% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). While individual investors were the group that reaped the most benefits after last week’s 8.4% price gain, institutions also received a 44% cut. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Riot Platforms, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Riot Platforms. Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Riot Platforms already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Riot Platforms' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Riot Platforms. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.1% and 3.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Soo Yi, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board. Furthermore, CEO Jason Les is the owner of 2.8% of the company's shares. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Riot Platforms, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$235m. Most would see this as a real positive. It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Riot Platforms. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Riot Platforms has   4 warning signs  (and 3 which are potentially serious)  we think you should know about.

LCID,"Tesla stock surges despite Trump's uncertain EV support. Tesla (TSLA) stock is soaring after former President Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. While CEO Elon Musk was a vocal supporter of Trump, the President-elect has not expressed the same enthusiasm for the electric vehicle industry. ""It's interesting because there's a lot of government help or regulation or incentive all pushing the electric vehicle transition, and Tesla's absolutely benefited from that. But we also know that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily support that thinking,"" iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. Brauer notes that a ""government-led transition to EVs"" is not a concept that Trump has embraced. He points to the broader EV market beyond Tesla, noting that other stocks in the sector are not experiencing the same rally as Tesla. ""It's interesting to see that people feel like Elon's relationship with Donald Trump will overcome a potential shift in policy,"" he adds. Moving forward, Brauer believes that Trump's policy regarding EVs may hurt the sector, including Tesla.

ABBV,"AbbVie's Emraclidine For Schizophrenia 'Surprisingly Disappoints,' Analyst Says Pipeline Is Underappreciated. On Monday, AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) stock plunged after two trials investigating emraclidine as a once-daily, oral monotherapy treatment for adults with schizophrenia failed two Phase 2 trials. The studies did not meet their primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score compared to the placebo group at week 6. PANSS is a scale used for measuring the symptom severity of schizophrenia. Also Read: Bristol-Myers Squibb Leads Biopharma Recovery With Almost 25% Growth In Market Cap, But Novo Nordisk And Lilly Suffer Market Setbacks. Cantor Fitzgerald points out that Wall Street had anticipated positive results from both of AbbVie’s studies, though they expected the details to be mixed, such as how impressive the PANSS score might be. Even with the negative results, Cantor Fitzgerald remains positive on AbbVie’s stock and believes the company's pipeline is undervalued. “This is disappointing and unexpected,” the analyst added. The disappointing AbbVie’s trial results is a benefit for Bristol Myers Squibb & Co’s (NYSE:BMY) approved schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, but they raise questions about using selective muscarinic targeting for treating schizophrenia and other conditions. The data could suggest differences between positive allosteric modulators like emraclidine and direct agonists like Cobenfy. Cantor maintains the Overweight rating with a price target of $240. Despite this setback, the Cerevel acquisition still holds promise, with other treatments like Darigabat (for epilepsy and anxiety) and Tavapadon (Parkinson’s) continuing to progress. Top-line results from the TEMPO-2 Phase 3 flexible-dose monotherapy trial of Tavapadon in Parkinson’s Disease are expected by the end of 2024.

The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, with four patients on Viking’s drug and two on placebo discontinuing the trial. Viking Therapeutics said it will begin a 13-week Phase II study of its oral candidate in Q4 2024. The company’s shares rose by 7.44%, from a close of $72.88 on 1 November to an open of $78.30 on 4 November after the company shared the positive data. It then fell by 19.36% before market close after Deutsche Bank analyst James Shin said it could be “costly with capital requirements and expertise” beyond major competitors, reports Reuters. Last month, Viking CEO Brian Lian claimed the company is in conversations with manufacturers to ensure a “blockbuster” supply. Viking also revealed more data from its Phase II study of a subcutaneous version of VK2735. The 13-week VENTURE study (NCT06068946) showed a mean weight loss of 14.7% or 13.1% adjusted for placebo, in the high dose cohort. The company announced mid-stage data from the VENTURE study in February 2024 which sent the company’s stock price soaring by 80%. The mid-stage data showed average weight losses of 9.2kg, 10.7kg, 13.3kg, 14.6kg, and 1.8kg in the 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The company was previously considering a Phase IIb trial but after sharing such positive data, it will be progressing straight to a Phase III trial after receiving the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to GlobalData, both oral and subcutaneous versions of VK2735 could become a direct competitor to Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide), the only dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist currently approved. GlobalData is the parent company of the Clinical Trials Arena. The weight loss field is heavily dominated by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1ra's), with Eli Lilly’s drug and Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide being the front runners. Semaglutide, marketed at Ozempic for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Wegovy for obesity is predicted to raise $42.85bn in sales in 2030, according to GlobalData. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s candidate, marketed as Mounjaro for T2D and Zepbound for obesity, is predicted to bring in £57.65bn in the same year.

VKTX,"Why Viking Therapeutics Stock Plummeted After Soaring Today. For high-profile biotech Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), Monday was very much a good news/bad news kind of day. The company reported quite encouraging clinical results from a version of its investigational weight-loss drug. Before long, however, this was overshadowed by promising news from rival developers of similar treatments. Ultimately, after an early surge, Viking's shares closed the day more than 13% lower in price. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». Viking presented those results at ObesityWeek, the annual meeting of scientific interest group the Obesity Society. Its presentations of that weight loss drug, VK2735, revealed that patients administered the highest dose of the drug in pill form lost over 8% of their body weight over a four-week period. This compared very favorably to the 1.4% recorded by patients taking a placebo, and also topped analyst expectations of 5% to 6%. Investors had been particularly interested in the VK2735 pill because the leading Food and Drug Administration (FDA) GLP-1 drugs approved for obesity are administered via injection. Specifically, these are Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Yet Viking's happy news was quickly overshadowed at the event by progress reported by other weight-loss drug developers. In its own presentation at the event, global pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca revealed that patients with type 2 diabetes who took the company's investigational drug saw a nearly 6% weight reduction. Meanwhile, Corbus Pharmaceuticals said that mice administered the highest dose of its pipeline drug experienced a weight reduction of over 31%. With these presentations, it's abundantly clear the obesity drug gold rush is only intensifying. The sky-high demand for weight loss drugs -- particularly in obesity-heavy America -- combined with the few advanced products currently available, make for quite the opportunity. Investors shouldn't get discouraged about this mounting competition for Viking, as the biotech clearly has an efficacious drug and is well advanced in developing it for commercialization.

INTC,"Recent uptick might appease Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) institutional owners after losing 32% over the past year. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions. 43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders. Recent sales by insiders. If you want to know who really controls Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). After a year of 32% losses, last week’s 13% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a possible sign that returns might start trending higher. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intel. See our latest analysis for Intel. Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intel. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intel's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intel. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intel Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$62m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 35% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Intel has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.

INTC,"Intel Stock Hasn't Been This Cheap in 10 Years. Is It a Buy? Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock delivered decent returns from 2010 through 2020, but over the last five years, its shares have been a lousy investment. The stock started to rebound in 2023 before plunging 54% in 2024. The share price is trading at the lowest level since 2013. Anytime a blue chip stock like Intel, a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, falls to multiyear lows, it can be easy to declare the stock ""cheap"" and buy it hoping for a big rebound. After all, Intel is the dominant supplier of central processing units (CPUs) for consumer PCs, and it has vast resources with $54 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». However, Intel is only cheap in price; it's not cheap based on its financial results and growth. In fact, based on market share losses and Wall Street's earnings estimates for 2025, I believe the stock is fairly valued and will probably continue to disappoint investors. The market for data center and server chips is exploding as companies upgrade to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Statista projects the AI server market to grow tenfold to $430 billion by 2033. Given this huge opportunity, investors should expect to see Intel growing faster than it is right now. Intel's data center and AI revenue grew just 9% year over year in Q3. This compares to competitor Advanced Micro Devices, which reported a 122% year-over-year increase in its data center segment, driven partly by AMD Epyc CPU sales. AMD believes it gained market share in Q3 in the server CPU market, and its relative growth to Intel backs that up. AMD is also beating Intel in the PC market. Intel said revenue from its client computing group fell 7% over the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, AMD's client segment posted an increase of 29% year over year, driven by strong demand for Zen 5 Ryzen processors. To be fair, Intel is still the leader in CPUs. Its share of the x86 CPU market was 62% in Q3, according to Statista. Intel's products are more widely distributed across the PC market, which gives it an advantage. But it doesn't appear Intel will stop losing share to AMD anytime soon. AMD's Ryzen and Epyc server CPUs rank at the top of Passmark Software's benchmarks on performance, which is not what Intel needs if it is going to regain the throne of industry-leading chip performance. The investment case doesn't hold up when investors look at Wall Street's earnings estimates and compare that to Intel's valuation. Analysts expect Intel to strengthen its profitability next year, as it launches new products, and report earnings per share of $1 in 2025. But the stock still trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 23 on those estimates, which is slightly higher than the S&P 500 average. Even if investors consider long-term growth, analysts only expect Intel to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 5% going forward. That's in line with previous estimates prior to the stock's fall. Intel could have an opportunity to beat Wall Street's expectations as more AI-enabled PCs become available. Intel has new Core Ultra processors and the upcoming Panther Lake chips that are designed to take advantage of AI PCs and could position it for a comeback in the consumer market. Still, AMD is also innovating with a pipeline of new chips to take advantage of the same opportunities. At this point, given the ongoing share losses, investors should wait before pulling the trigger on Intel stock. Until the company starts to stabilize its market share losses with new products, Intel won't provide enough growth to provide satisfactory returns to shareholders even at these lower share prices.

PFE,"2 Magnificent S&P 500 Dividend Stocks Down Year to Date to Buy and Hold Forever. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has a lot of winners in its ranks, which is why the famous stock market barometer is up more than 31% since the start of 2024 as I write this. Yet in any collection numbering hundreds of stocks, there are bound to be some laggards, and that's the case with this closely watched index. As we prepare to leave this year behind, this is a look at a now-undervalued pair that are down year to date in price, yet continue to shower their investors with dividends. Here's why I'm drawn to these two tarnished beauties: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Nike (NYSE: NKE). Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». In the somewhat upside-down world of the pharmaceutical industry, a scary global health emergency can be quite the boon for business. During the COVID pandemic's height, for example, Pfizer was not only the co-developer of the widely distributed Comirnaty vaccine, it was also the entity behind the go-to drug therapy Paxlovid. This one-two combination pushed revenue and profitability stratosphere-high during those otherwise trying times. That was then, this is now. For investors, it's been a case of ""What have you done for me lately?"" with Pfizer. Comirnaty and Paxlovid are hard acts to follow, and both the company's top and bottom lines are down from their pandemic peaks. Adding to Pfizer's challenges, activist investor Starboard recently bought an anchor stake, and has since been agitating for changes in a pull-no-punches, activist investor sort of way. Starboard essentially argues that Pfizer's strategy of acquiring promising drugs is pricey, and hasn't produced meaningful results. I look at it differently. The pharmaceutical development process is arduous and resource-consuming, so for a deep-pocketed operator like Pfizer, it often makes sense to buy products that have already traveled some distance down the pipeline. I think the company's deal-making has been sensible, like when it closed a $43 billion arrangement to acquire cancer-focused biotech Seagen late last year. Pfizer left Starboard with a bit of egg on its face with the third-quarter results it unveiled at the end of October. Again, COVID is still a menace, and thankfully for the world -- and Pfizer investors -- Comirnaty and Paxlovid were ready for the fight. Sales of both leaped on a year-over-year basis, helping the company to a monster 31% improvement in revenue (to $17.7 billion), and a flip into non-GAAP (adjusted) profitability, to more than $6 billion. As a company that frequently posts profits in the billions of dollars, you can bet there's usually plenty of cash on hand to fund Pfizer's dividend. Not only that, the company keeps declaring dividend raises every year, and while these are typically incremental, they do add up. These days, combined with that sunken share price, Pfizer dispenses a high-yield dividend that tops 6%. Quick, name a top athletic apparel brand! Most likely, your response was ""Nike,"" since after many years it is still the most famous maker and purveyor of cool shoes for every conceivable sport, and the clothing and accessories that complement them. The company's ""swoosh"" logo is instantly recognizable. Few businesses achieve that kind of brand power. In the likely case it doesn't diminish much, this should keep Nike front of mind for many people who like such products. The company needs this now, since it's been in a slump for years. Former CEO John Donahoe shifted the company's sales strategy to digital and direct sales, forsaking the broad retail market. While this looked good on paper in these online-everything times, the move made Nike less of a presence. This diminished the power of the brand, and -- not coincidentally -- resulted in weaker sales growth and even recent declines. Donahoe is no longer in the CEO position. Last month, Nike brought in 32-year company veteran Elliott Hill to replace him. Hill was at the shoe and apparel maker during its many glory years, when growth was robust and the brand was a choice selection at the top athletic wear retailers. At the very least, a change in strategy is coming, and I'd expect Nike to revert to its previous methods of pushing product onto third-party retailers. Innovation could get a boos, too, since Hill surely remembers how well the company did with memorably unique, proprietary goods like Air Jordans. Meanwhile, despite sputtering growth, Nike has held steadfast to its policy of paying a dividend. It is not only a reliable payer every quarter, it's also a constant lifter, having declared dividend raises consistently since 2004. Free cash flow has been on the rise, providing not only enough room for the current payout, but likely future dividend raises, too. Dividend raises tend to be declared near the end of every calendar year, so we can expect a new one to be announced by Nike soon. At the moment, the company's quarterly distribution is $0.37. This yields 1.9% at the current stock price, comfortably above the 1.3% average of S&P 500 index component stocks and helping make Nike a stock to buy.

PFE,"Is The Market Rewarding Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) With A Negative Sentiment As A Result Of Its Mixed Fundamentals? Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has had a rough month with its share price down 11%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pfizer's  ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Pfizer. ROE can be calculated by using the formula:. Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity. So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:. 4.7% = US$4.3b ÷ US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit. We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. On the face of it, Pfizer's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 21%. Therefore, Pfizer's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors. As a next step, we compared Pfizer's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the company's growth is slightly less than the industry average growth of 0.1% in the same period. The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Pfizer fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 35% (or a retention ratio of 65%), Pfizer hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds. In addition, Pfizer has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Pfizer is speculated to rise to 17% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE. In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Pfizer's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

NIO,"Why Nio Stock Plunged 23.7% in October. After a dull first half of the year or so, Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock rebounded dramatically to gain almost 65% in the month of September alone. However, Nio's rally seemed unsustainable at least in the short run, and the electric vehicle (EV) stock ended October down 23.7%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In particular, Nio's numbers failed to live up to investors' expectations, but there's no need to panic. Investors in Nio stock should, instead, watch out for the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker's next big event on Nov. 20. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». After Nio's bumper second quarter, I warned investors to temper their expectations from the company. It was, after all, an exceptional quarter, during which Nio's deliveries jumped 144% year over year following a long, challenging period. Last month, Nio announced an 11.6% year-over-year growth in its deliveries for the third quarter, including a 35% increase in deliveries for September. It was a record quarter, but investors expected more, and the stock tumbled. With updates from China further failing to impress, Nio shares continued to fall through October. You see, Nio is a prominent player in China's EV market, with a market share of more than 40% in the EV segment priced above 300,000 yuan. So when China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), announced a stimulus package some weeks ago, Chinese stocks like Nio surged as investors expected local manufacturers to benefit from the government's stimulus measures. Investors betting on Chinese stocks expected the NDRC to reveal more details and, perhaps, an even bigger package at an event in October, but that was not to be. The NDRC announced nothing new, sending the Hang Seng index and Nio stock plunging. The next big trigger for Nio stock could be its third-quarter earnings release on Nov. 20. While Nio has already announced its Q3 delivery numbers, the key number to watch out for is margin. In Q2, Nio reported a vehicle margin of 12.2% versus 9.2% in the first quarter. Management said it expects margins to grow further in the remaining two quarters of the year and hit 15% by the end of the year. That's a key number, and it'll be worth tracking how Nio achieves the target especially now that it has a cheaper model on sale, the Onvo L60 SUV. Onvo is Nio's first mass-market brand and L60 the first model under Onvo, deliveries of which began in September. Nio sold around 4,300 units under Onvo in October, which pushed its total monthly sales above 20,000 units yet again. With management expecting Onvo to become a bigger brand, striking a balance between rising sales of a lower-priced product and margins could be tricky.

NVDA,"Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Nov. 20? Here's What History Suggests. Over the last couple of weeks, investors have been anxiously waiting for various companies to report third-quarter earnings results. Factors including the election and high-profile themes in artificial intelligence (AI) have added an extra layer of ambiguity to this specific earnings season. For the most part, big tech reports have been pretty solid. But the ""Magnificent Seven"" member that everyone is most curious about has yet to report: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). That will change on Nov. 20. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». This particular earnings report could be more meaningful than the usual one. Here's what investors should be looking for, and my view on whether they should scoop up shares before the highly anticipated data drop takes place. For the last two years, Wall Street analysts and investors who follow Nvidia have been laser-focused on the growth trends in its compute and networking business. In particular, sales related to the company's data center services and graphics processing units (GPUs) seem to be all anyone wants to talk about. The upcoming earnings report will be no different. When CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress address investors during the earnings call, I can just about guarantee the executives will be peppered with questions about one specific thing: the upcoming launch of its Blackwell chip line, Nvidia's most powerful GPUs yet. While early reports have suggested that Blackwell could generate $10 billion in revenue by the end of the year, there's a finer detail that I would encourage investors to be on the lookout for. One of Nvidia's closest partners is IT infrastructure company Super Micro Computer. Supermicro specializes in providing the storage cluster architectures that house GPUs such as those made by Nvidia. However, over the last few months, Supermicro has been at the center of some drama. Namely, the company delayed filing its annual report, and last week was dropped by its auditor. In response, Nvidia is reportedly moving some of its supply chain efforts away from Supermicro in favor of other IT architecture specialists. While this seems like a logical move to make, I will be curious to see if this transition impacts Nvidia's financial guidance related to Blackwell in any way. The chart below traces Nvidia's stock price over the last two years, with annotations that show when its quarterly reports arrived. Around the time of its earnings reports, investors can see that Nvidia's share price tends to experience a bit more volatility and momentum. In my eyes, Nvidia's commentary around Supermicro and Blackwell could influence the stock price pretty dramatically one way or another. The bigger idea in play here is that Nvidia stock has risen substantially over the last couple of years and that the share price has demonstrated a fair amount of resiliency even after some short-lived sell-offs. While Nvidia's multibagger returns over the last couple of years certainly make the stock tempting, investors need to keep in mind that competition in the GPU space is on the rise. Although this won't be too detrimental to Nvidia, new chips from other vendors could put a dent in the company's growth down the road. At the end of the day, I think investors should listen closely to any comments from Nvidia's leadership related to Blackwell that could help them discern how these new GPUs will fare in the face of rising competition. To me, buying Nvidia ahead of its upcoming earnings report carries too much risk -- a move more suited to a short-term trader than a long-term investor. For that reason, I'd sit on the sidelines with Nvidia for now, and would encourage investors to continue gathering as much information as possible before following the crowd.

NVDA,"Terry Smith Shuns Nvidia Shares on Fears AI Hype Is Overblown. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s stock has almost tripled this year, and Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg. The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly. Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump. Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District. Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration. But, Terry Smith isn’t impressed. The money manager, who’s been dubbed by the UK press as Britain’s Warren Buffett, is skeptical as he says the world’s largest stock lacks a predictable earnings stream and a strong track record of high return on capital. Smith is avoiding the shares even as he acknowledges that such a move undercuts his portfolio’s performance. “I’m not confident that we know what the future of AI is because there are almost no applications people are paying for,” Smith said in a Nov. 5 interview in Tokyo. “Will they be willing to pay on a sufficient scale and a sufficient price to justify this? Because if not, the suppliers of the chips are going to have a problem.”. Smith’s caution strikes at one of the biggest concerns about the future of the artificial intelligence industry: will the revenue generated by the technology ultimately justify the billions of dollars of investments the firms have plowed in? The doubts contributed to a selloff which erased about $900 billion from Nvidia’s market value from a June peak to an August low, although the shares have since rebounded. AI enthusiasts note that Nvidia’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., have pledged to pump more into capital spending after splashing a record $59 billion into data center gear and other fixed assets in the third quarter. Strategists expect the company to record a net profit margin of 56% in the 2025 fiscal year as tech firms continue to boost AI spending to keep up with rivals. But, Smith thinks such hefty margins may not last. “Even if AI is the next big thing and we’re going to be paying enough money to justify it, is there just going to be one manufacturer of these chips?” he said. “If you are making fantastic returns, it attracts competition.”. “In fact, if you look at the people who are the big users of the microprocessors that Nvidia is supplying, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, they have a history of developing their own,” he added. Smith’s Fundsmith Equity Fund returned 9% this year in dollar terms, trailing the MSCI World Index of developing-market stocks which has gained almost 20%. The underperformance is due to “concentration of performance amongst a handful of stocks,” Smith said, adding that the rising popularity of index funds is fueling this trend. “The popularity of index funds is worrying,” he said. “A lot of people call them passive. But they are not passive. They are momentum strategy. And the momentum will last until it doesn’t.”.

META,"Meta’s Updating its Terms of Service With Clarified Wording Around Misuse. This story was originally published on Social Media Today. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter. Meta’s informing users of some minor updates to both its Terms of Service and Community Standards, with a new in-stream pop-up alerting users to the update. The updated terms mostly relate to wording changes, with stronger language around platform misuse, and more direct explanations as to how you can use certain elements, and what you’re agreeing to in regards to personal data use. First off, Meta’s updated its opening paragraph to basically explain that if you use its apps, you’re agreeing to these terms. “These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.”. The wording here includes a sentence that’s currently buried further down in the terms, making it clear that by using its apps, you are indeed agreeing to these terms. The update also includes more specific explanations around misuse of Meta’s apps, and the scraping of data from them. “You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a Facebook account.”. That last sentence has been added, clarifying that you can’t use the fact that you were logged into Facebook as an excuse for data scraping. This distinction, between logged in and logged out access, has been used in the legal defense of some scraping cases. There’s also a new explanation about circumventing Meta’s protection measures, and how that’s also a no-no. Meta’s also included some specific qualifiers on avatar and AI use, based on its separate agreements for each:. “If you use Avatars, then the Avatar Terms also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the Meta AI Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict."". As noted, the references to its separate Avatar and Meta AI terms here are new, ensuring that these documents, which already exist, are also specifically noted within the initial user agreement. Meta’s Avatar and AI terms cover the use of your personal data inputs for these elements, including, say, selfie videos for avatar creation, or the sharing of your conversations with Meta’s AI tools with third parties. Why would Meta need to share your AI chats? Well, it might need to pass on your query to Google or Bing to get search results from the web, though the terms also cover any internal reviews of your AI prompts and other usage. So there’s a range of things that you’re agreeing to, which are not new, as such, but are now being more explicitly built into Meta’s usage agreements. On its Community Standards, Meta’s not actually updating the document, but it is merging its Community Standards that cover Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads into one central location for easier access. So if you see this new prompt, now you’ll know what it is you’re agreeing to. Meta’s Community Standards will be merged as of November 12th, while the new Terms of Service go into effect from January 1st, 2025. Sign in to access your portfolio.",Neutral

BBD,"Bradesco Stock (NYSE:BBD): Betting on a Turnaround Is a Risky Move. Bradesco (NYSE:BBD), a major player in Latin American banking, has lagged behind its peers due to a challenging macroeconomic environment and less efficient asset management. Despite efforts at a robust turnaround, I currently take a neutral stance on BBD. While BBD trades at a discount compared to its local competitors, the investment thesis for Bradesco hinges more on its turnaround strategy than on solid fundamentals. I believe when it comes to investing in banking stocks, this shouldn’t be the ideal approach. In this article, I’ll delve deeper into why Bradesco finds itself in this predicament. Bradesco stands among Brazil’s private banking giants, competing head-to-head with Itaú Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) and Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR) while also contending with state-owned banks like Banco do Brasil (OTC:BDORY) and Caixa Econômica Federal. Its business model spans banking and insurance, targeting Brazil’s middle-class and low-income demographics. However, this diverse credit portfolio has posed challenges, causing Bradesco to underperform compared to some of its local rivals. The bank has faced stiff competition from digital banks like Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) and Inter & Co (NASDAQ:INTR), hindering its growth in recent years. Adding to its challenges, Brazil’s credit environment has been declining, though a modest recovery is anticipated in 2024. Bradesco has struggled with rising default rates, with its 90-day non-performing loans (NPL 90+) spiking from 2.6% in March 2021 to a peak of 7.2% by September last year, though it has since eased to 6.4% as of March 2024. Several factors contributed to this surge. First, Brazil’s inflation soared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting 12% early in 2022. Second, credit growth slowed throughout 2023, spurred by double-digit interest rates aimed at curbing inflation. Alongside these macroeconomic pressures affecting the entire banking sector, Bradesco faced a more specific issue. Due to its substantial exposure to retail credit, Bradesco set aside an extra provision of R$4.9 billion (over a billion USD) in February last year to cover its exposure to an accounting scandal involving the retailer Americanas, which severely impacted the bank’s bottom line. Consequently, Bradesco saw a sharp decline in its profitability from 2022 to 2023. The bank’s return on average equity (ROAE) plummeted from 18.7% in Q1 2021 to 10.2% in Q1 2024, which explains why its stock has depreciated by approximately 64% over the past five years. For comparison, Itaú Unibanco and Banco do Brasil, the top performers in the industry, reported an ROE of over 21% in the latest quarter. Comparing Bradesco’s stock performance with its main domestic peers reveals it has performed the worst over this period. To turn around the adverse situation of the past five years, Bradesco has embarked on a comprehensive operational restructuring. In November 2023, Bradesco announced Marcelo Noronha as its new CEO. By February 2024, Bradesco unveiled a strategic restructuring plan set to be implemented through 2028. This plan includes significant changes, particularly at the C-Level, aimed at optimizing cross-selling processes and re-segmenting the bank’s service areas. The primary goal is to enhance efficiency, targeting a 40% efficiency ratio (where lower is better). In Q1 2024, the bank reported a 50% ratio. Achieving this target will require meticulous management of operating expenses, and while this will take time, some progress is already evident this year. First, there was an improvement in provisions. In Q1 2024, Bradesco reported an almost 18% drop in provisions compared to Q1 last year, totaling R$7.8 billion. Operating expenses fell 10.5% quarter-over-quarter to $13.4 billion, though they were up 4% year-over-year. Bradesco posted a net profit of R$4.2 billion, a significant 46% increase quarter-over-quarter, though a slight 1.6% drop year-over-year. Its annual return on average equity (ROAE) of 10.2% marked an improvement of 3.3 percentage points quarterly but was partially offset by the 0.4 percentage points drop year-over-year, still trailing the bank’s historical levels. Although the turnaround is progressing slowly, these are small victories for Bradesco’s shareholders to celebrate. The current scenario also highlights the rather derisked valuation multiples at which Bradesco has been trading. The bank trades at a P/B ratio of 0.7x, indicating more about market concerns over the bank’s future profitability than necessarily viewing BBD as undervalued. In the past three months, only Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Mario Pierry has weighed in on Bradesco stock with a Hold recommendation. Despite his neutral stance, Pierry has set a price target of $3.20 per share on BBD stock, suggesting substantial upside potential of 38.8%. Bradesco has been the laggard among Brazilian banks, taking the hardest hits due to its focus on middle and low-income customers, making it more vulnerable to economic headwinds. The weighty provisioning for the Americanas scandal further dragged down its performance, squeezing its efficiency. Now, management is racing against the clock to turn this sleeping prominent Brazilian bank around. While the conditions might be improving for a recovery, betting on a downturn is a risky play, and the bullish case doesn’t quite shine, either. Disclosure.

NVDA,"Nvidia, Intel, and other chip stocks are dragging down the Nasdaq even as the Dow gains. Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. Shares of Intel (INTC) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU) was down by around 3.5%. Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore. The world’s largest chipmaker was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw green Monday as stocks continued a post-election rally sparked by former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitcoin also surged on the election victory, reaching a record $84,000. With Trump’s return to the White House, the chip war between the U.S. and China could escalate. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.”. Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. TSMC has also reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",Pessimistic
MPWR,"Monolithic Power Falls Amid Risk to Nvidia Allocation, Edgewater Research Reports. Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR, Financials) shares dropped by double digits in premarket trading Monday following a report from Edgewater Research indicating potential risks to the company's allocation in Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell GPU line. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Edgewater analysts said that Monolithic's allocation in Blackwell might be drastically limited or eliminated by performance problems with its voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits. Given both businesses got recent rush orders, Japanese semiconductor company Renesas and Germany's Infineon Technologies may absorb Monolithic's share; Renesas reportedly took up the B200 allocation and Infineon possibly managing the GB200. Though it might result from a product failure in Blackwell's setups, where power usage topped 700 watts, Edgewater experts indicated the source of Monolithic's power management IC problem is ""unclear."" Though Monolithic may maintain shipments for B300A (700 watts), this performance issue leaves Monolithic with ""limited or no"" allocations for B200 (1,000 watts) and GB200 (1,200 watts). The analysts also said that while Nvidia is probably looking at Monolithic's confirmed orders for next quarters, it has already canceled about half of Monolithic's backlog, therefore affecting all unverified orders. By early 2025, they stated Nvidia may raise Renesas's part of the Hopper GPU allocation to 50% from around 15% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Infineon hasn't yet qualified as a Hopper supplier however. Edgewater claims that while Monolithic's latest solutions are just short patches rather than long-term solutions, Nvidia's engineering staff has apparently turned trust toward Renesas and Infineon as main suppliers. We view this as creating a substantial downside risk for MPWR's Enterprise Data segment in 2025, the analysts concluded, stressing issues over the possible effect on Monolithic's shares, especially amid investor attention on the company's AI-related performance.

MPWR,"Why Monolithic Power Systems Plunged Today. Shares of Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ: MPWR) plunged on Thursday, down 18.2% as of 1:39 p.m. ET. The company reported earnings last night, and while reported results showed strong growth beating expectations, Monolithic's fourth-quarter outlook may have disappointed. Furthermore, the company received an ominous downgrade today. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». In the third quarter, Monolithic reported revenue growth of 30.6% to $620.1 million, with earnings per share growing 31.8% to $4.08. Both figures handily beat analyst expectations. However, Monolithic's forecast for fourth-quarter revenue only amounted to $610 million at the midpoint, implying a quarter-to-quarter drop. While the muted fourth-quarter revenue outlook may be attributed to the delay in Nvidia Blackwell chips, Monolithic didn't have much room for error, as the stock had just about doubled over the past year, trading at over 100 times trailing earnings and 50 times forward earnings estimates going into the report. Of note, Monolithic makes the semiconductor-based power solutions that go into a variety of growth markets, including data centers, automotive applications, and consumer and industrial electronics. On the subject of the Nvidia chip, one Wall Street analyst downgraded the stock based on increasing competition for Nvidia systems. Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann downgraded Monolithic from buy to neutral on Thursday, citing the fact that Monolithic will likely cede some market share in the Blackwell module to competitors Infineon and Renesas in the future. Thursday was a very bad day in general for semiconductor stocks, and at around $743 per share as of this writing, Monolithic trades well below even the lowest sell-side analyst price target of $880 today. Certainly, it seems Monolithic's technology is well positioned, given the extreme power needs of AI data centers and electric vehicles.

RIOT,"Is Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) One Of The Worst Falling Stocks To Buy Now? We recently compiled a list of 10 Worst Falling Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we will look at where Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) ranks among the 10 worst falling stocks to buy now. To the new investor, the stock market can appear to be an unpredictable graph that has no inherent logic to its ups and downs. However, this is far from reality as all stock performance is primarily driven by fundamentals, market sentiment, news, large buys or sells, and other factors. As a result, the astute investor can make money on stocks by trying to predict whether a firm has sizeable catalysts that are not accounted for in the share price. Of course, this is a risky approach, and one that isn't recommended by Warren Buffett as we covered in 10 Best Stocks For Beginners With Little Money. However, as hindsight is 6/6, looking back into time explains a lot about how firms see their share prices drop. Diving deeper, one doesn't have to look far to find stocks that have struggled in the wake of shocking and disappointing fundamental performance. One of the best examples of 2024 is the 12th Best Data Center Stock To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts. Set up in 1968, the firm has defined the era of personal computing through its processors. Yet, in a world that's thirsty for chips in 2024, its shares are down by a painful 52% year to date and a stunning 69% since their peak in August of 2000. So why is this stock falling even though it has $191 billion in total assets, $25 billion in cash and equivalents, and generated $55 billion in trailing twelve month revenue? Well, the answer is simple. During its second quarter of 2024, the firm's profit dropped by 85% annually as it posted a net loss of $1.6 billion. Its size and scale had enabled the firm to be a dividend paying stock, a fact that had helped it retain some stock value even as troubles started to become evident last year. The current dividend yield is 2.29%, but the dividends will be suspended starting Q4 as part of the firm's $10 billion cost reduction plan. Its shares tanked by 30% after the second quarter earnings, and investor pessimism is baked in due to the competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. The chip manufacturer has lost its lead in developing cutting edge semiconductor manufacturing technologies to a Taiwanese rival, and investors are on the sidelines as its own 18A chip process is only expected to lead to revenue in late 2025 and beyond. Yet, even though a 52% year to date drop is bad, it doesn't make the firm one of the worst falling stocks right now. When we consider falling stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million, one notable example in 2024 is an autonomous driving stock that was a billionaire hedge fund boss's 4th best long term stock pick as of Q3 2023. The fund had first bought the stock in Q2 2021, and its shares are down by 73% year to date. This firm manufactures light detection and radar (LiDAR) sensors that are primarily used by autonomous vehicle companies to sense their environment. As has been the case with the chip manufacturer, the firm's troubles also have to do with its business. However, while the semiconductor industry is robust, the auto industry and particularly the electric vehicle sector have struggled due to high rates depressing prices. For this particular stock,  the troubles were evident in February when the shares slipped by 10% after it announced that its biggest customer Volvo was experiencing production delays. The woes were further exacerbated in April after a BofA note downgraded the shares to Underperform from Neutral and slashed the share price target to $1.20 from $3.50. Its stock tumbled by 16% as the analysts noted that ""model launch delays and reduced volume expectations for vehicles expected to adopt LIDAR technology drive a meaningful drop in our volume forecasts."" The final nail in the proverbial coffin came in August after $16.5 million in revenue and $0.18 loss per share missed FactSet analyst estimates of $20.4 million and $0.17 million. The stock dived by another 37% and has been in the dumps since then. Speaking of the car industry, another falling stock in 2024 was ironically the 11th best performing stock on the NASDAQ exchange in 2023 as of October 2023. The stock had posted a 288% gain by then, and in 2024, the shares are down 78.8% year to date. This firm is a lithium miner, however, it has yet to produce a profit, and operating expenses have increased right when lithium prices are at historically low levels. The lithium industry slowdown has pushed out its profit estimates for the future, and consequently, the shares have suffered. Our Methodology. To make our list of the worst falling stocks to buy, we ranked the 50 worst performing stocks of 2024 with a market cap greater than $300 million by their short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding. Out of these, the stocks with the highest short interest percentage were selected. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 12. Short Interest % of Shares Outstanding: 16.52. YTD Share Price Loss: 51.14%. Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is a Bitcoin mining company based in Castle Rock, Colorado. The firm has been at the center of news coverage in form or another in 2024. Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) made a big announcement in May when it announced an acquisition offer for Bitfarm. The team aimed to make the firm the biggest Bitcoin miner in the world with a power capacity of 1.5 GW and a hash rate of 52 EH/s. However, Bitfarm rejected the offer, but ongoing negotiations led to the two announcing an agreement in September that saw a Bitfarm founder step down and Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) agreed to withdraw its requisition. The stock has suffered this year also due to the impact of a short seller report in June which accused the firm of burning cash. Cash is important for the firm as it is targeting aggressive expansion by ordering more than 60,000 miners and setting up substations with more than 100MW of capacity. Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT)'s 400MW substation also suffered from a delay earlier this year, and these moves have stemmed from its revenue dropping because of Bitcoin's halving in 2024. During its Q2 2024 earnings call, Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT)'s management shared how it's navigating through a tough environment:. ""However, driven by the significant growth in our hash rate capacity expected through the remainder of the year, we anticipate producing more Bitcoin per day by the end of 2024 than we did in the first quarter of 2024, halving non-withstanding. Riot ended the second quarter of 2024 with 9,334 Bitcoin, an increase of 28% relative to the 7,265 Bitcoin that we held at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Riot continued to retain 100% of all Bitcoin produced in the second quarter. In the second quarter of 2024, Riot reported total revenue of $70 million as compared to $76.7 million for the second quarter of 2023, a 9% decrease year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue at the company’s engineering division. During the quarter, Riot reclassified third-party hosting revenues and costs into other from Bitcoin mining, as previously reported in the first quarter of 2024."". Overall RIOT ranks 5th on our list of the worst falling stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of RIOT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

SMCI,"Here's Why Super Micro Computer Stock Fell Again Monday. Management at Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) gave investors a much-anticipated business update last week that did not appease investor concerns. And the company faces yet another major hurdle this week. Concerns about an upcoming deadline as well as fears of lost business opportunities have the stock sliding today. As of 10:40 a.m. ET, Supermicro shares were starting off the week down by 11.1%. That brings the monthly drop in the stock to about 53%. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». Supermicro provides server stacks and cooling systems for data center computers. Its business had been ramping up quickly with surging revenue as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing accelerated data center growth. But after a short-seller report and the company delaying the release of its 10-K annual report, investors had to question the legitimacy of the company's prior financial results. Last week Supermicro provided an update saying sales would be slightly lower than prior guidance. It also said an investigation by a special committee found ""there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors."". While that sidesteps a worst-case scenario, the company has yet to file its annual report for its fiscal year ended June 30. It now faces a Nov. 16 deadline to offer a plan to the Nasdaq Stock Exchange to regain compliance according to stock listing rules. A delisting from the major exchange would very likely lead to more selling of Supermicro stock. Investors are getting ahead of that potential drop by selling shares today, it seems. The move shouldn't be looked at as a buying opportunity either. Reports have also said the company is losing business due to the instability of the situation. Supermicro is best watched from the sidelines unless or until the company shows in its annual report that its business is stable and its financial data is accurate.

SMCI,"Nvidia's Latest Move Just Gave Supermicro Investors Some Epically Bad News. There has been no other company in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm that's been watched as closely as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the last couple of years. Nvidia's role in the AI narrative is so prominent that any announcement the company makes has the power to swing the capital markets at this point. As the company's upcoming launch of its new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture (GPU) looms, all eyes are on Nvidia and its partner network. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one player that's been a direct beneficiary of Nvidia's booming GPU business over the last two years. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». However, some recent reporting suggests that Nvidia may be migrating away from its reliance on Supermicro's IT infrastructure and looking for partnerships elsewhere. Let's break down the situation and assess what could be influencing Nvidia's decisions. Moreover, I'll explore how this news has been impacting Supermicro stock and what it could mean for investors in both the near and long term. The launch of the Blackwell chips may be the most hyped-up AI event of 2024. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has boasted that demand for the new chipsets is ""insane."" Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's research team is forecasting $10 billion in sales from Blackwell just in the fourth quarter. While all of this is good news on the surface, there are some wrinkles unfolding in the background that smart investors should be keen on watching. According to an article posted on Digitimes, Nvidia is said to be routing Blackwell orders away from Supermicro in favor of other IT architecture specialists. The last couple of months have been brutal for Supermicro. Back in August, Supermicro became the subject of a short report published by Hindenburg Research. Hindenburg alleges that Supermicro's accounting controls are weak — essentially implying that something fishy could be going on with its bookkeeping and potentially the financial outlook of the company. To be honest, I didn't think much of Hindenburg's allegations at the time. After all, short-sellers have a vested interest in seeing a stock price decline — which is exactly what happened following the short report. However, Supermicro ended up delaying its annual report following the Hindenburg report. While this wasn't the best look, I remained cautiously optimistic about Supermicro. But then, in late October, Supermicro filed an 8-K to notify investors that its auditor, big four accounting firm Ernst & Young, had resigned. Considering how much is on the line with anything related to Blackwell, it's not surprising to learn that Nvidia is reorganizing its supply chain protocols. For now, Supermicro's top priorities should be to mitigate any further drama and get its audit and annual filing under control. Unfortunately, I think any work related to Blackwell just adds additional pressure on Supermicro right now, and a failure to execute would only result in more drama surrounding the company. It's hard to know the exact magnitude that Nvidia's Blackwell orders were for Supermicro. Supermicro operates in a highly intensive environment and is far from the only company specializing in storage clusters and server rack designs for data centers. Since the Hindenburg report was published, shares of Supermicro are down 58% (at the time of this writing). So, while migrating Blackwell orders away from Supermicro will decelerate the company's growth and signal an extra kernel of unwanted news, there's an argument to be made that its impact is already baked into the company's share price to some degree. Conversely, shares of Nvidia have been experiencing quite a bit of momentum as of late. In fact, as of the time of this article, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world by market cap, eclipsing Apple by roughly $200 billion. I think this price action speaks volumes about how excited investors are for Blackwell and what management may reveal later this month when Nvidia reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 20. I'm curious to learn if moving orders away from Supermicro will have any material impact on shipments of Blackwell, and if so, how that will impact Nvidia's growth in the near term. For now, shares of both Supermicro and Nvidia are experiencing outsized volatility, and I think it's in the best interest of investors to sit on the sidelines and let the near-term narratives surrounding Blackwell continue to unfold. AI is a long-term theme, and investors will have ample opportunities to invest in either Nvidia or Supermicro at more prudent times and reasonable price ranges.

SMCI,"Can Anything Save Super Micro Computer? What is going on at Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI)? Shares of the once high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) server company have collapsed after a growing scandal has enveloped the business. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». This timeline shows how the story has unfolded:. Aug. 27: In a short-seller report, Hindenburg Research accuses the company of accounting manipulation, self-dealing, sanctions evasion, and channel stuffing. The stock plunges. Aug. 28: Supermicro files notice that it's unable to submit its 10-K in a timely manner. At the time, it said it needed more time to ""complete its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting."" It also said it didn't anticipate any changes to the fiscal 2024 results it had reported on Aug. 6. Sept. 3: Supermicro sends a letter to customers and partners, reasserting it didn't anticipate material changes to its fiscal 2024 results. It also called the short-seller report false and inaccurate while reminding customers that recent events don't impact its products. Sept. 20: Supermicro says it received a letter from Nasdaq saying it was out of compliance because of its late 10-K filing. The company has 60 days to regain compliance or submit a plan for doing so. Sept. 26: The Wall Street Journal reports the Justice Department is investigating Super Micro Computer, apparently in response to accusations from a former employee about accounting violations. Oct. 30: Supermicro says its auditing firm, Ernst & Young (EY), has resigned. In July, EY had communicated concerns about Supermicro's financial reporting, warning that a timely filing of the 10-K was at risk. EY ultimately told the company it couldn't rely on management's representations and is unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by the company. Nov. 5: Supermicro reports preliminary fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings, missing estimates. The stock tumbles further. Supermicro reported preliminary first-quarter results, and the numbers were both incomplete and below expectations. It said revenue would fall in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.0 billion, below its previous guidance of $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion. On the bottom line, it expects adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.76, at the middle of its previous range of $0.67 to $0.83. For the fiscal second quarter, management sees revenue falling sequentially to $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.65. Management also noted its Independent Special Committee found the Audit Committee ""acted independently,"" contrary to EY's concerns that it was influenced by the CEO. In the press release, the Special Committee said:. [T]here is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors. The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measures for the Company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next. Despite this update, Supermicro still has no timeline for when it will file its 10-K, though it intends to do so according to Nasdaq's compliance rules. At this point, Supermicro is two quarters behind on its financial reporting. The stock is down over 50% since the release of the Hindenburg report, and it has fallen 80% from the all-time high it reached in March. In the meantime, the company needs to hire a new auditor, and management should share a plan to rectify that problem as soon as possible. Management also needs to complete the filing of its 10-K and give investors a reasonable expectation of when the filing will take place, or at least shed light on the issues preventing it from happening. Management mostly avoided discussing those problems on the most recent earnings call. Though management insists no material changes will need to be made to its fiscal 2024 results, the allegations from Hindenburg Research, EY's resignation, the possible DOJ investigation, and Supermicro's own inability to resolve the matter in more than two months indicate this could be more than a run-of-the-mill procedural error. Despite what management has said, financial restatements are possible and could go back quarters or even years. Until investors get more transparency from management and see that it's clearly taking steps to regain compliance, the stock should be avoided. For current shareholders, making the decision to sell is more difficult as the stock has already fallen so far, but the reality is Supermicro's sell-off may not be over. It's easy for the business to spiral from here if it loses trust with its customers. Reports are now emerging that Nvidia, Super Micro Computer's most important supplier, is redirecting its in-demand chips to other server companies, fearing a crackdown on Supermicro related to any DOJ investigation and potential damage to its own reputation. It's time for management to come clean with investors and stop obfuscating. If it doesn't resolve some of these problems by the end of the month, it faces a real threat of being delisted from the Nasdaq, which would make it even more difficult to restore its reputation with investors. Super Micro Computer is running out of time, and it needs to act. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

MNDY,"Why Monday.com (MNDY) Stock Is Falling Today. Shares of project management software maker Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) fell 18.3% in the morning session after the company reported underwhelming third-quarter financial results, with sales in line with analysts' estimates. Similarly, revenue guidance for the next quarter was also mostly in line with expectations. Notably, the muted sales guidance for the next quarter implied revenue growth of around 28-29%, suggesting growth may be slowing. Monday.com also announced a change in leadership. Yoni Osherov, monday.com's Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), is expected to step down from his role at the end of December 2024. With the company still in search of his replacement, there is an added element of uncertainty that markets have to contend with. It isn't hard to understand why markets might struggle to digest this news, as Osherov was considered pivotal in the company's growth, helping to increase ARR (annual recurring revenue) from $10 million to over $1 billion. On a more positive note, earnings (non-GAAP EPS) beat Wall Street's estimates as gross margin ticked up slightly relative to the previous year while operating margin was in line. Overall, this was a mixed quarter, with the stock's reaction suggesting that markets are growing agitated by the decelerating top line growth and the uncertainty caused by the leadership update.

Monday.com’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Monday.com and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 23.8% on the news that the company reported a 'beat and raise' quarter. Monday.com materially improved its net revenue retention. Its revenue also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, the company raised its full year guidance across the board. The full year operating profit raise was particularly large, showing that the business is more profitable than expected. Overall, this quarter's results were great and shareholders should feel optimistic. Monday.com is up 52.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $271.50 per share, it is still trading 16.3% below its 52-week high of $324.31 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Monday.com’s shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,516.

ABBV,"Why AbbVie Stock Was Getting Mashed on Monday. Disappointing news from the laboratory weighed on AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) stock as the trading week kicked off. The company had high hopes for a schizophrenia drug it was developing; however, it did not do well in recent testing. On the company's latest readout, investors were aggressively trading out of the shares, leaving them with a 12% decline in late-afternoon trading. Just before the market open on Monday, AbbVie revealed that its emraclidine schizophrenia treatment did not meet its primary endpoint in a phase 2 trial. It failed to show a statistically significant reduction in the benchmark Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) compared to a placebo. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». The company said, perhaps understating the case, that it is disappointed by the results. It pledged to continue analyzing the data from the trial to determine the next steps with emraclidine. Often, such results put an end to a drug's development. In the news release about the trial, AbbVie's chief scientific officer Roopal Thakkar said that the company is still ""committed to finding better treatments for people living with psychiatric and neurological disorders."". It's no surprise that management would express hope that it'll successfully develop a new product for such afflictions. In early August, it closed a deal valued at $8.7 billion to acquire emraclidine's developer, Cerevel Therapeutics. The schizophrenia drug was one of the main reasons AbbVie bought the company. Cerevel wasn't a one-trick pony, however. For its considerable spend, AbbVie also acquired several other pipeline programs from the neuroscience-focused biotech. The most promising of these is Parkinson's disease tavapadon, which in contrast to emraclidine has done well in recent late-stage trials.

ABBV,"AbbVie Tumbles After New Schizophrenia Drug Fails Two Trials. (Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc. shares fell the most in more than four years after two mid-stage trials of its drug to treat schizophrenia failed to meet their primary goal, a blow to the company’s $8.7 billion acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics earlier this year. Most Read from Bloomberg. The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly. Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump. Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District. Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration. The medicine, emraclidine, didn’t show a statistically significant improvement on a scale used for measuring the severity of symptoms of the mental illness, AbbVie said Monday. The company plans to analyze the data to determine next steps. AbbVie shares fell as much as 13% as of 11:15 a.m. in New York, their biggest intraday drop since March 2020. The stock had gained 29% this year through Friday’s close, outperforming a 26% rise in the S&P 500. “This outcome is a real dagger” for AbbVie, Mizuho analyst Jared Holz wrote in a note, calling it “another example of a major disappointment a buyer may face when acquiring a company prior to pivotal data.”. The North Chicago-based drugmaker pursued big M&A deals over the past few years to build out its pipeline in the wake of fading sales of its biggest product, the anti-inflammatory drug Humira. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted emraclidine would bring in $1.1 billion in annual sales in 2029, based on the benefits seen in early-stage testing. But the new studies announced Monday found no statistical difference between the medicine and a placebo. Higher doses didn’t appear to be more effective, which might have provided hints of a path forward for AbbVie and new Chief Executive Officer Rob Michael, who took the helm in July. For AbbVie investors, “an $8.7B ‘mistake’ is likely to weigh on sentiment for some time,” wrote Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond. Bristol Surges. AbbVie’s setback was viewed as a victory for Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which in late September gained US approval for the first new type of schizophrenia drug in seven decades. Bristol shares jumped as much as 13%, the most since March 2006. “The failure here will significantly bolster” Bristol’s lead in the evolving market, said Paul Matteis, an analyst at Stifel. For decades, schizophrenia treatments have largely focused on dopamine receptors. But those drugs don’t work for many patients. And due to their unpleasant side effects, such as weight gain and drowsiness, fewer than half of patients stay on their medications. The treatments from AbbVie and Bristol are part of a new class of drugs that have a different target — muscarinic receptors, which modulate brain circuits that are disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. This new mechanism holds the promise of treating the symptoms of the mental illness without as many side effects. Bristol acquired its schizophrenia treatment when it agreed to buy Karuna Therapeutics for $14 billion last year. AbbVie’s drug works slightly differently than Bristol’s treatment. While the schizophrenia drug was a big focus for AbbVie investors, Cerevel’s pipeline also includes drugs to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions including Parkinson’s disease and mood disorders. --With assistance from Robert Langreth.

MRNA,"Moderna's Q3 Earnings Beat Overshadowed By Vaccine Demand Slowdown And Market Share Concerns, Analysts Warn. On Thursday, Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported third-quarter revenue of $1.83 billion, beating the consensus of $1.25 billion. The company attributed the growth to higher sales in the U.S. market following the earlier launch of the updated COVID-19 vaccine. BofA Securities notes that Moderna’s stock rose early Thursday but ended the day lower, likely due to slowing vaccine trends and uncertainty around the company’s respiratory vaccine lineup, as well as new concerns related to Trump and Kennedy’s positions on vaccines. The analyst has reduced the price target from $110 to $90, adjusting for a higher discount rate (9% instead of 7%) based on updated commercial risk expectations, lower sales forecasts for COVID-19 and RSV vaccines, and reduced net cash. The analyst maintained a Neutral rating on Moderna. Also Read: Moderna Hit With Another Lawsuit Related To Key COVID-19 Vaccine Technology. Leerink Partners notes the earnings update didn’t improve the negative outlook for COVID and RSV, and the revenue beat, driven by excess inventory, pointed to weak earnings quality. The company faces challenges from declining COVID demand and losing market share to Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which could affect Moderna's ability to clear excess inventory and raise concerns about potential write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2024. Leerink has lowered the price target from $46 to $38, with an Underperform rating. Oppenheimer remains optimistic about the long-term potential of Moderna's RSV vaccine, mRESVIA growth. “We think MRNA is well-positioned to extend the mRESVIA label into high-risk adults 18-59, filing an sBLA with PRV by YE24,” the analyst writes, and maintains the Perform rating. The analyst notes mRESVIA launch will take longer than expected but still considers it an undervalued asset, particularly with its upcoming label extension. The analyst also adds, “We are impressed by MRNA’s progress toward opex optimization and believe such efficiency could invite a larger upside for its upcoming pipeline launches.”. The company expects the cost of sales to be 40-45% of product sales for the year (previously 40-50%), with R&D expenses anticipated to be $4.6 billion—$4.7 billion (previously $4.8 billion).

The company is significantly slowing production to match demand in Q4 and implementing further cost reductions, particularly in SG&A. Celanese Corp (NYSE:CE) is focused on deleveraging its balance sheet to three times net debt-to-EBITDA as quickly as possible. The company expects the Clear Lake asset to provide a $100 million benefit on a full-year basis, with additional contributions expected in the coming quarters. Celanese Corp (NYSE:CE) is actively pursuing divestitures and other strategic actions to support its financial goals and improve cash flow. Q3 results were disappointing, and the outlook for Q4 and into 2025 is below expectations due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. As tools like ChatGPT by OpenAI become more popular, a larger debate has been ignited among AI businesses in the United States over content creation and copyrights. AI startup OpenAI, the most valuable private firm in the world, recently won an important battle in this regard when a New York federal judge on November 7 dismissed a lawsuit against the company that alleged that the startup had misused articles from news outlets Raw Story and AlterNet to train its large language models. A spokesperson for the startup said in a statement following the ruling that OpenAI had built their AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by long-standing and widely accepted legal precedents. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The win is likely to further boost the future prospects of OpenAI, a startup that is already investing in other AI ventures. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, claim that the company was part of a funding round for Physical Intelligence, a startup that is developing foundational software for robots, earlier this week. The robot startup managed to raise more than $400 million in funding through the round. This valued the firm at more than $2 billion. Jeff Bezos and venture capital firms like Thrive Capital and Lux Capital were also part of the funding round. Research by venture capital firm Accel suggests that funding of AI and cloud companies in the US, Europe, and Israel is estimated to hit $79.2 billion by the end of 2024.

META,"Facebook seeks to scuttle massive securities fraud suit. This story was originally published on Legal Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Legal Dive newsletter. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a multibillion-dollar shareholder lawsuit that accuses tech giant Meta of fraud by omitting allegedly key information from the risk disclosure statements it shared with potential investors. The case of Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank involves a massive data breach stemming from the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, obtained data on millions of Facebook users and then used that data to create psychological profiles of American voters to help the presidential primary campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican. The data breach ultimately affected 30 million Facebook users. Facebook’s annual 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission warned about improper third-party access and the misuse of private user data as a hypothetical risk that could harm the company’s business and reputation. But it did not mention that such a data breach had occurred. That omission did not sit well with the Supreme Court’s more liberal justices during an unusually lively oral argument on Wednesday. Justice Elena Kagan wondered, for instance, if a company warned generally of a fire risk but knew that a recent fire had destroyed 50% of a plant’s production capacity, if the company’s omission of the fire damage would be misleading. When Meta’s attorney Kannon Shanmugam said there would be no implied misrepresentation in that instance, Kagan countered, “That’s going to be of interest to the reasonable investor,” and likened the situation to Facebook’s omission. “You’re throwing the investor off the scent,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said later in noting that a general warning leads reasonable investors to believe no data breach happened in the past. The attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case, Kevin K. Russell of Goldstein, Russell & Woofter, made a similar point. “Our theory of liability is this monumentally important event happened in the past, and Facebook misled investors by not disclosing this occurrence,” said Russell. But several of the court’s conservative members appeared concerned that SEC regulations did not require such a disclosure. Chief Justice John Roberts told Russell, “It seems to me this would be a real expansion of the disclosure obligation.”. Along similar lines, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wondered why the SEC could not resolve the case with clearer instructions. “This raises lots of questions for companies about what they have to disclose and what they don’t,” he said. The Biden administration sided with the plaintiffs, with Assistant Solicitor General Kevin Barber telling the court, “This is a bread-and-butter half-truth case.”. But Shanmugam warned the justices that the implications of a win for the plaintiffs would be to hold companies liable for warning about all sorts of risks for anything that had ever occurred in the past. He suggested that such a result would trigger concerns about over-disclosure by companies in risk disclosure statements. A divided Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel found that Facebook’s risk statements were misleading when it knew the exact risk had already happened. Falsely implying that serious misappropriation had not occurred was misleading, the panel held, even if the extent of the ensuing harm remained unknown.

AMD,"Insiders At Advanced Micro Devices Sold US$7.5m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness. In the last year, many Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices. Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP & GM of Data Center Solutions Business Unit, Forrest Norrod, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$176 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$148. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. In the last year Advanced Micro Devices insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! I will like Advanced Micro Devices better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying. Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Advanced Micro Devices insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about US$1.4b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders. There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Advanced Micro Devices insiders selling. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Advanced Micro Devices, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

BBD,"Banco Bradesco S.A. (BBD): Among the Worst Affordable Stocks to Buy Under $10. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Worst Affordable Stocks Under $10. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD) stands against the other worst affordable stocks to buy under $10. Wall Street and the market are celebrating the Fed rate cut from last week. However, the shadows of uncertainty are still hovering over, especially with the upcoming elections. Fundstrat Global Advisors' Co-Founder Tom Lee and Professor Jeremy Siegel are optimistic about the market going into a period of growth at least until the elections. We recently discussed this point of view about how the market is expected to grow with the interest rates coming down. You can take a look at 10 Worst Performing Affordable Stocks Under $40, to read more about it. Here’s an excerpt from the article:. “Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and Wisdom Tree chief economist, recently appeared on CNBC and expressed that he was pleasantly surprised by the Federal Reserve’s decision to make a 50 basis point cut. While talking about how the market is going to perform after the announcement, Professor Siegel said the market is going to be at an all-time high and there are not going to be any fluctuations as we have seen in the past few days. It is true that interest rate cuts help both growth and value stocks, but which ones are doing better? The current market trend shows the interest rate cut expectation and the announcement supported growth stocks more than the value stocks and also resulted in small caps becoming new favorites. Talking about value stocks and how the market could be entering into a slower growth period, Vahan Janjigian, Chief Investment Officer at Greenwich Wealth Management, and Margaret Patel, Senior Portfolio Manager for multi-asset solutions at Allspring Global Investments discussed this in a recent CNBC interview. Janjigian expressed his cautiousness regarding the market even after the Fed cut rates. He believes that interest rates will go up in the long term. It is because the market is eventually going to get a more normalized yield curve, which he believes is good for the economy. If the yield curve continues to follow the upward trajectory, it will favor value stocks more than growth stocks. Stated that the market moves in the direction Janjigian expects, we can see a sell-off for the stocks that are currently moving higher, including the tech and growth stocks. Moreover, he also pointed towards some of the biggest investment risks. He mentioned that the rising deficit, debt, and cost of servicing the debt are some of the biggest threats. Debt is also one of the reasons interest rates could potentially go up in the future, as the debt grows it can potentially push the market-determined interest rate higher. It is important to note that Janjigian's strategy is somewhat hedged, meaning he has stakes in both large and small-cap stocks, indicating that any market outcome will eventually benefit his portfolio. Adding to this Patel is thinking along the same lines as well. She also believes that the upcoming quarter could be slower, mainly due to the delay by the Fed in lowering the rates. Patel expects the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate of merely 1% to 1.5%. Talking about her popular stock picks, she prefers companies with sustainability and earnings levels above the market average. Our Methodology. We used the Finviz stock screener to get a list of stocks under $10 that are trading at a discount to the market average (forward P/E is 23 according to data from WSJ) with earnings expected to grow this year. Using this criteria, we shortlisted 20 stocks and then selected 10 stocks that were most widely held by hedge funds. We ranked the stocks in descending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Please note that all data was recorded on September 22, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

U,"Why Unity (U) Shares Are Falling Today. Shares of game engine maker Unity (NYSE:U) fell 8% in the afternoon session after the company reported weak third-quarter earnings. Its full-year revenue guidance was underwhelming and its EBITDA guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street's estimates. And while sales came in ahead of expectations during the quarter, it still translated to an 18% year-on-year decline, which is concerning. Given that markets are forward-looking, the weak EBITDA guidance meant investors were likely to overlook the bottom line beat recorded in the quarter. Unity called out market uncertainty, particularly with slower recovery in key growth segments and ongoing caution around customer renewals. As a reminder, Unity recently updated its pricing plans to a subscription-based model, making it easier for consumers to adopt after a backlash from its user community. The pricing updates are set to take effect on January 1, 2025, which means some customers might delay renewals. These factors likely impacted the company's ability to project stronger future performance. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Unity? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Unity’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 34 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock dropped 19.1% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with full-year 2024 revenue and EPS guidance falling short of analysts' estimates. Although this quarter's headline revenue beat, Unity stated it benefited from a unique event where one of its customers, W?t?, terminated its service agreement and opted for a perpetual license to access its software. This resulted in a one-time revenue boost of $99 million - without this sale, Unity's revenue would have been $510 million, dropping 2% year on year. In its shareholder letter, James Whitehurst, the company's recently appointed CEO (October 2023), also shared Unity's new strategy. The company's reset will be split into two phases, the first being to focus on its core business by narrowing its investments. Unity also intends to right-size its cost structure, as seen in its January 8th layoff of 25% of its workforce. Phase one is expected to finish by the end of Q1, and once Unity's leaner cost base is established, it plans to return to growth initiatives and new product development. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Unity, and investors are likely uncomfortable with the company's outlook. Unity is down 47.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $20.48 per share, it is trading 52.1% below its 52-week high of $42.73 from December 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Unity’s shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $299.63.

SMR,"What’s next for nuclear stocks after regulatory pushback? Nuclear energy stocks have become a favorite of Wall Street this year as the artificial intelligence boom spreads and Big Tech searches for ways to meet its growing power demand. They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. ""The order may not represent a long-term risk,"" ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy."". Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.”. “It could be as high as 10%, 20%,” Sell added. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk also recently contextualized the amount of power the AI boom is going to require. His data shows that you’d have to add three New York Cities' worth of power to the grid by 2030 to meet the demand that is going to come from artificial intelligence. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.). Tech companies see nuclear as a way to meet that demand. That may be one reason why Amazon is not done with co-location, telling Yahoo Finance via email that “we remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives.”. Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez also rebuffed regulators on his company's earnings call, which came one day after the ruling, saying, ""Co-location in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the US to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI."". Despite beating on earnings and revenue, Constellation stock (CEG) fell after the company reported third quarter results due to fallout from the Talen news. But CFRA's Rich said Constellation is a stock to watch in nuclear. “I think Constellation is the most buyable dip,"" he said. ""Constellation … is by far and away the largest nuclear operator, more than three times more megawatt capacity than the next competitor. And we think that in our view, nuclear is really one of the best ways to service this type of demand from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, [and Magnificent Seven] names that have large needs for power.”.

TSM,"Why Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Fell Today. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), a semiconductor manufacturer, fell today after Reuters reported that the U.S. Commerce Department told the company to stop sending its advanced chips to China, effective immediately. TSM's stock was down by 3.56% as of 4 p.m. ET. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free ». The U.S. government has been cracking down on chipmakers exporting processors to China that are used for artificial intelligence (AI), but some chips have slipped through the cracks. Last month, TSM said one of its processors had somehow ended up in a Huawei AI data center. Huawei is a Chinese company that's on a trade restriction list. TSM has been communicating regularly with the U.S. government, and today it received a letter from the Commerce Department saying that its 7-nanometer and other advanced chips can't be sent to Chinese companies. The U.S. and China are competing for AI dominance, and the U.S. is concerned that China could use advanced chips for its military. That fear has led the government to issue restrictions on the types of chips companies sell to China. TSM isn't the only company that falls under the restrictions; Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have also cut back on sending semiconductors to China. About 11% of TSM's revenue in the third quarter came from China, so investors probably shouldn't be too concerned that scaling back sales to Chinese companies will hinder the company's growth too much. But they should keep an eye on increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, as any additional geopolitical instability could put pressure on TSM's stock.

TSM,"US orders TSMC to halt advanced AI chip shipments to China. The US has ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to cease shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers, specifically those used in AI applications, reported Reuters, citing a source. Effective from 11 November 2024, this directive targets chips of 7nm, or more advanced designs that power AI accelerators and GPUs, the source said. The US Department of Commerce’s order follows TSMC's notification to the department that one of its chips was found in a Huawei AI processor, a discovery made by tech research company TechInsights. Huawei, central to US action, is on a restricted trade list, requiring suppliers to obtain licences to ship goods or technology to the company. Licences that could support Huawei's AI efforts are likely to be denied. TSMC halted shipments to Sophgo, a Chinese chip designer, after its chip was found in the AI processor developed by Huawei. The publication reported it was unable to determine how the chip made its way into Huawei's Ascend 910B, launched in 2022 and regarded as the most advanced AI chip from a Chinese company. The US action impacts many companies and allows the US to assess if others are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor. The Commerce Department declined to comment on the matter. Taiwan's Economy Ministry stated: “TSMC has had regular discussions with the government on export control issues and has made it clear that it will comply with domestic and international regulations.”. A TSMC spokesperson added that the company is “committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls”. Ijiwei, a Chinese media site, reported that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies of the suspension of 7nm or below chips for AI and GPU customers, starting this week. This action comes amid concerns from US lawmakers about export control inadequacies on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement.
